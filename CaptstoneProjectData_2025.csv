....Urgent ==,"I'm Mrs. Jennette Campel the widow of late Mr James I'm 68 years old. I am a Christian convert, suffering from prolonged cancer of the
breast, from alll mediical indications my condition has really deteriorated and it's pretty obvious that i may not live for more than
six months owning to the rapid growth by stage and the excruciating pain that accrues to it.

My husband was killed during the Political War, and our long years of marriage were not blessed with any child. My late husband was very wealthy, after his death I inherited  his business and funds. My doctor has diagnosed and told me privately what i should expect,
building my spirit for the inevitable. He says i may not last for more than 6 months, based on this i have taken the decision to share part of my funds and wealth in contribution to the development of the Church and society with major focus on the poor, needy and victims of
HIV / AIDS.

I am willing to donate the sum of $ 38.900,000 USD for your work in developing the Church and to help the poor, needy, and less privileged among your congregations/society.  note that this fund is deposited in a bannk in the country where my husband worked, my lawyer
will file the application for the transfer of this m0ney in your na me and information's, after my applications and instructions.

I honestly employ you to make sure that these funds are put to use  for this purpose, a good one you can agree with me, I  realize
that wealth without lifie in Christ is vanity. contact me for more information because I don't know what may happen to me next.

May the grace of God be and remain with you. reply to (ja6562123s@outlook.com)

Mrs. Jennette Campell

Hello,


I hope this message finds you well. As a former staff member of the college, I recently came across your email on the College website. I wanted to reach out to you regarding an exciting opportunity. My uncle will be relocating to the college area this summer, and he is in need of someone who can provide care and attention to his beloved pets.


Specifically, he is looking for someone who can take care of his furry companions by sitting with them, taking them for walks, and ensuring they are fed properly. To make this arrangement mutually beneficial, he is offering a competitive weekly payment of $400.


If you happen to know any staff or students who might be interested in dog-sitting, I kindly request you to refer them to my uncle. They can simply send an email to general.gary.oyler@outlook.com, providing their name, phone number, and email address. This will allow my uncle to get in touch with them and discuss the full terms and requirements of the job.


Thank you for your time and assistance. Your referral could potentially help my uncle find a reliable and caring individual to take care of his fur babies. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or need additional information.


Best regards.

***SPAM Suspected*** GOOD MORNING,"Dearest in the Lord,

I would like to donate a fund through you to finance the maintenance of the underprivileged in your country, local orphanages, women cooperatives, religious organizations, natural disasters affected persons and families in your Municipal/State under your supervision.

To know more about me, I am Mrs. Malika Omanaly, a widow suffering from a long-time illness (Septicaemia). I am married to late Mr. Mathews Omanaly, who worked with the Bahrain embassy in Ivory Coast. Unfortunately, He died after a brief illness that lasted for four days which the doctor confirmed that he was poisoned. My late husband was eliminated by his own family brothers because we converted from Muslim to Christianity of which led to his brother’s hatred against his personality. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home.

When my late husband was alive, he deposited the sum of US$ 2.600.000 (Two Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars) in a bank here in Ivory Coast. My late husband instructed that this fund should be used for charity development such as to build orphanage homes, school, health centres, and churches, help widows and to endeavour that the house of God is maintained. My late husband and I have special love for Animals and wanted to establish a Safari Lodge and an Animal care Foundation where Animals will be treated and taken care of for free.

Recently my doctor told me that I may not last for the next three months due to this terminal illness and my medical report proves that I may not survive this disease much longer. Having known my condition and as I don't have any child that will inherit this money, I decided to accomplish my late husband's wish to donate this fund to an individual or organization that will use this fund as instructed by my late husband.

Meanwhile, I could have donated this money here in this country, but my late husband warned me not to let his brothers and relatives know about this fund, and I don't intend to disobey him even in death. My intention is divine and very clear to the glory of God. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going; I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. With God all things are possible.

Please I don't need any telephone communication regarding my health condition, hence the presence of my late husband’s relatives are always around me; I don't want them to know about this development. As soon as I receive your reply and your E-mail address, I shall forward to you the certificate of deposit and the contact of the bank, I will also issue to you an authorization letter that will prove that you are the present beneficiary of this fund.

Please I want you and your family to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. I will want you to assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein, and please always be prayerful all through your life.

Thanks, and remain blessed.
Mrs. Malika Omanaly.

The tіtlе of your puƅlisհed artіclе is Exploring Student Engagement Factors in a Blended Undergraduate Course. and the аƅstrаct: Student engagement is an important factor in асаdemiс performance and comprises four dimensions: behavioural, cognitive, emotional (Fredricks et al., 2004), and agentic (Reeve, 2013). Blended courses provide unique opportunities for instructors to use trace data collected during learning to understand and support student engagement. This mixed-methods case study compared the student engagement of two groups of students with a history of low prior асаdemiс achievement. The groups were (a) students who ultimately did well in the course and (b) students who did poorly. Data came from two primary sources: (a) log file data from the course LMS, and (b) trace data derived from authentic learning tasks. Data represented five indicators: (a) behavioural engagement, (b) cognitive engagement, (c) emotions experienced during learning, (d) agency or proactive approaches to studying, and (e) overall асаdemiс engagement. Findings indicated students who moved achievement groups showed higher levels of behavioural engagement, cognitive engagement, and agentic or proactive approaches to studying and overall engagement. Additionally, students who remained in the low achievement group showed higher levels of positive deactivating emotions (e.g., relief). Implications for future rеsеаrch on student engagement and designing teaching to increase engagement in blended courses are discussed. (English)

Hi. How are you?

I know, it’s unpleasant to start the conversation with bad news, but I have no choice.
Few months ago, I have gained access to your devices that used by you for internet browsing.
Afterwards, I could track down all your internet activities.

Here is the history of how it could become possible:
At first, I purchased from hackers the access to multiple email accounts (nowadays, it is a really simple thing to do online).
As result, I could easily log in to your email account crystalm@uvic.ca.

One week later, I installed Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all devices of yours, which you use to open email.
Frankly speaking, it was rather straightforward (since you were opening the links from your inbox emails).
Everything ingenious is quite simple. (o_0)!

My software enables me with access to all controllers inside devices of yours, like microphone, keyboard and video camera.
I could easily download to my servers all your private info, including the history of web browsing and photos.
I can effortlessly gain access to all your messengers, social networks accounts, emails, contact list as well as chat history.
Virus of mine constantly keeps refreshing its signatures (because it is driver-based), and as result remains unnoticed by your antivirus.

Hence, you can already guess why I stayed undetected all this while.

As I was gathering information about you, I couldn’t help but notice that you are also a true fan of adult-content websites.
You actually love visiting porn sites and browsing through kinky videos, while pleasuring yourself.
I could make a few dirty records with you in the main focus and montaged several videos showing the way you reach orgasm while masturbating with joy.

If you are still uncertain regarding the seriousness of my intentions,
it only requires several mouse clicks for me to forward your videos to all your relatives, as well as friends and colleagues.
I can also make those vids become accessible by public.
I honestly think that you do not really want that to happen, considering the peculiarity of videos you like to watch,
(you obviously know what I mean) all that kinky content can become a reason of serious troubles for you.

However, we can still resolve this situation in the following manner:
Everything you are required to do is a single transfer of $977 USD to my account (or amount equivalent to bitcoin depending on exchange rate at the moment of transfer),
and once the transaction is complete, I will straight away remove all the dirty content exposing you.
After that, you can even forget that you have come across me. Moreover, I swear that all the harmful software will be removed from all devices of yours as well.
Make no doubt that I will fulfill my part.

This is really a great deal that comes at a reasonable price, given that I have used quite a lot of energy to check your profile as well as traffic over an extended period of time.
If you have no idea about bitcoin purchase process – it can be straightforwardly done by getting all the necessary information online.

Here is my bitcoin wallet provided below: bc1qgfef9nlwffftl6m5qet95yxa0x7arah0h580gs

You should complete the abovementioned transfer within 48 hours (2 days) after opening this email.

The following list contains actions you should avoid attempting:
#Do not try calling police as well as other security forces. In addition, abstain from sharing this story with your friends.
After I find out (be sure, I can easily do that, given that I keep complete control of all your devices) – your kinky video will end up being available to public right away.
#Do not try searching for me – there is absolutely no reason to do that. Moreover, all transactions in cryptocurrency are always anonymous.
#Do not try reinstalling the OS on your devices or throwing them away. It is pointless as well, since all your videos have already been uploaded to remote servers.

The following list contains things you should not be worried about:
#That your money won’t reach my account.
– Rest assured, the transactions can be tracked, hence once the transaction is complete,
I will know about it, because I continuously observe all your activities (my trojan virus allows me to control remotely your devices, same as TeamViewer).
#That I still will share your kinky videos to public after you complete money transfer.
– Trust me, it’s pointless for me to continue troubling your life. If I really wanted, I would make it happen already!

Let’s make this deal in a fair manner!

Owh, one more thing…in future it is best that you don’t involve yourself in similar situations any longer!
One last advice from me – recurrently change all your passwords from all accounts.

My son Mark Frank-Perry who has received early admission into the Pearson B. Gustavson School of Business for Sept2020 has some questions. We have connected with Robert since his participation in our annual career fair in Ahousaht, so we like to keep him in the loop.

May we plan to have a phone conversation: you, Mark, Pam (mom,wife) and me? Good times would be tomorrow afternoon, or any day next week before 10am?

Please advise.

Hi Cindy and Anisa,

Students can apply to a different faculty and then apply to transfer to the School of Music for Year 2.  The first year of the Music programs are quite structured so students may not be able to get all of the courses done through another faculty, however they can take a good majority of them   For your reference, here is the program planning worksheet for Music Education:

The other areas of Music (performance, musical arts, musicology, etc.) will have slightly different courses in the upper years.  You can find all online.

Anisa can take a mix of the courses required for our Music programs, as well as more general courses that fulfill the (scroll to courses, competencies and GPA to see course list).  It will be important for Anisa to meet with an Academic Advisor in May/June to help with course planning.

The Faculty of Social Science or Humanities would be a good faculty to apply to as this will allow the most flexibility with course selection.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

Cheers,
Stephanie

Hello Stephanie,

 My daughter currently attends and will graduate from Vic High this year. She was planning on applying for the Music program; however, she is feeling unprepared to apply and have all requirements before the deadline. She is planning on getting a B/A in music and then continue on to the Education PDPP program. What we are now wondering is if she can take the pre-requisites for the Elementary PDPP as her first year studies at UVic, and then enroll into the music program. If this is possible what program would she be best to enroll into?

Thank you for your time and consideration, we look forward to hearing from you.

Good Day,

I am sure that covid19 has impacted normal outreach efforts for both the UVIC and the student.

Our son is 17 years old, Ahousaht and has been struggling. Fortunately he is at home and thus we have been able to intervene. That said, we are not in-sync with best practices for an indigenous student at UVIC.

Mark has been in contact with the good people at the BCOM Advisors office...THANKS.

Mark tells us that he has not received any support from the good people at the UVIC First Peoples House. To us, this would look like UVIC reaching out to a first year student who is indigenous and developing a relationship that is perhaps even a weekly engagement?

We mean no disrespect, our son's education is important to him, us and our community.

Kleco Kleco for considering our words as caring, helpful and respectful to one another.

Thank you for your interest in the University of Victoria (UVic), one of Canada's top-ranked comprehensive universities. My name is Brian Tucker, and your email has been forwarded to me as I am an Admissions Liaison who specializes in assisting prospective graduate students.

Admission information, including admission minimums from countries throughout the world, a found at.

As a prospective graduate student, I suggest you begin by reviewing a complete list of our graduate programs at.

A significant part of the preparation required to apply to an appropriate graduate program will be to look at the specific research areas for different faculty members within a given department. As you are not just looking for a program of study, but for potential supervisors who will work with you when you are writing your major graduate research paper or thesis, this will be a key step in your process.

Lists of faculty members and their specializations are typically found on their respective departments websites. You can also learn about the work of UVic researchers at .

Once you have narrowed down what program(s) you are interested in and which researchers you may be interested in working with, the next step for you will be to visit the department website, which you can find through the following webpage: .

Here, you will want to choose your program area, either from the drop-down menus under quot;Search programsquot; or from the A-Z hyperlinked program listings. Clicking on the specific program heading (e.g. quot;Anthropologyquot;) will bring you to the website for the programs you are looking for.

In addition to reviewing the specific admission requirements for the given department, you will also be required to meet the minimum admission standards outlined by the Faculty of Graduate Studies. You may view these at .

All of our graduate programs require you to demonstrate English language proficiency to be eligible for admission to your program of choice. You will find a detailed list of options for meeting the proficiency requirement at .Many of UVics prospective graduate students will take a TOEFL or IELTS: if you take an internet-based TOEFL, you will need a minimum overall score of 90 with no less than 20 per category, and if you write an IELTS, you will need a minimum overall score of 6.5 with no less than 6 per category to meet the English language proficiency requirement.

You can find out about funding options for graduate students at

Finally, when you are ready to apply, you can begin the process by visiting. Here, you will find step-by-step instructions that will guide you through the application process.

Good day to you.

I am Dr. Benson C. Lee, a medical doctor from France. I have something
very important to discuss with you privately about a citizen of your
country, who was among the dead victims of the (COVID-19) in April
(2020) in our Hospital. It was very unfortunate that since (2) years
now, our hospital is looking for the family in your Country, and I do
not have any address to locate the family in your Country. Please, I
am contacting you, because you have the same surname, if there is any
way you will help our hospital to locate the family.

I look forward to your quick response.
Yours Faithfully.
Dr. Benson.

Due payment   13.12.2022 4:17:52,"Greetings!
Have you seen lately my e-mail to you from an account of yours?
Yeah, that merely confirms that I have gained a complete access to device of yours.

Within the past several months, I was observing you.
Are you still surprised how could that happen? Frankly speaking, malware has infected your devices and it's coming from an adult website, which you used to visit.
Although all this stuff may seem unfamiliar to you, but let me try to explain that to you.

With aid of Trojan Viruses, I managed to gain full access to any PC or other types of devices.
That merely means that I can watch you whenever I want via your screen just by activating your camera as well as microphone, while you don't even know about that.
Moreover, I have also received access to entire contacts list as well as full correspondence of yours.

You may be wondering, quot;However, my PC is protected by a legitimate antivirus, so how could that happen? Why couldn't I get any alerts?quot;
To be honest, the reply is quite straightforward: malware of mine utilizes drivers, which update the signatures on 4-hourly basis,
which turns them to become untraceable, and hereby making your antivirus remain idle.

I have collected a video on the left screen where you enjoy wanking, while the video on the right screen shows the video you were watching at that point of time.
Still puzzled how much damage could that cause? One mouse click is enough for me to share this video to your social networks, as well as e-mail contacts of yours.
In addition, I am also able to gain access to all e-mail correspondence as well as messengers used by you.

Below are simple steps required for you to undertake in order to avoid that from occurring - transfer $450 in Bitcoin equivalent to my wallet
(if you don't know how to complete that, just open your browser and make a google search: quot;Buy Bitcoinquot;).

My bitcoin wallet address (BTC Wallet) is:
BTC : bc1qgc7epqfh755j33pudjckx399st8vk8dnksq2d2



Once the payment has been confirmed, I shall remove the video without delay, and that is end of story - afterwards you won't hear about me again for sure.
The time for you to perform the transaction is 2 days (48 hours).
After this e-mail is opened by you, I will get an automatic notice, which will start my timer.

Any effort to complain will not change anything at all, because this e-mail is simply untraceable, just like my bitcoin address.
I have been developing these plans for quite an extended period of time; so, don't expect any mistake from my side.

If, get to know that you tried to send this message to anyone else, I will distribute your video as described earlier.

***SPAM Suspected*** READ AND REPLY URGENT,"Hello Dear God,s Select Good Day,

I apologized, If this mail find's you disturbing, It might not be the
best way to approach you as we have not met before, but due to the
urgency of my present situation i decided  to communicate this way, so
please pardon my manna, I am writing this mail to you with heavy tears
In my eyes and great sorrow in my heart, My Name is Mrs.Juliette
Morgan, and I am contacting you from my country Norway, I want to tell
you this because I don't have any other option than to tell you as I
was touched to open up to you,

I married to Mr.sami Morgan. Who worked with Norway embassy in Burkina
Faso for nine years before he died in the year 2020.We were married
for eleven years without a child He died after a brief illness that
lasted for only five days. Since his death I decided not to remarry,
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of € 8.5 Million
Euro (Eight million, Five hundred thousand Euros) in a bank in
Ouagadougou the capital city of Burkina Faso in west Africa Presently
this money is still in bank. He made this money available for
exportation of Gold from Burkina Faso mining.

Recently, My Doctor told me that I would not last for the period of
seven months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is
my stroke sickness.Having known my condition I decided to hand you
over this money to take care of the less-privileged people, you will
utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.

I want you to take 30 Percent of the total money for your personal use
While 70% of the money will go to charity, people in the street and
helping the orphanage. I grew up as an Orphan and I don't have any
body as my family member, just to endeavour that the house of God is
maintained. Am doing this so that God will forgive my sins and accept
my soul because these sicknesses have suffered me so much.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the
bank in Burkina Faso and I will also instruct the Bank Manager to
issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present
beneficiary of the money in the bank that is if you assure me that you
will act accordingly as I Stated herein.

Always reply to my alternative for security purposes

Hoping to receive your reply:
From Mrs.Juliette Morgan,

Just wanted to let you know that we have addressed the comments below and Liang has competed her review.

On a side note, I broke out Inventory for September 2021 for $5,427 and updated AD accordingly.

Thank you,

Subject: RE: Statement of cash flows reviewed

Thank you, Emmy. Looks great. Confirmed that my detail review comments were addressed. I made some updates as attached and below are some additional review notes. You can send directly to Liang for Controller high level, review and CC me once completed.

   *   Interest paid – I think it may be missing the interest paid on the Scilex Bridge loan and the Levena Loans
                  *   ACEA China Interest Paid on the loan YTD $321k
                  *   Scilex CNH YTD $104
                  *   Levena China $239

   *   I dropped in the Q3 Levena Loans schedule from Ling, and added an additional payment / loan we received in Q3 and also some FX effect. – thank you!
   *   Total consolidated net income does not tie to v2 SEC mapping files. I think you may have to adjust cell AI69 to reflect the YTD change in NCI (to agree to equity roll). You probably are aware of this and are waiting to determine NCI allocation. – ZFB numbers finalized with Liang and tie to ER. $41k was waived on by the controller in difference for Accumulated Deficit for Q3 as relates to ZFB.

Subject: Statement of cash flows reviewed

Hi Emmy,

I have detail reviewed the statement of cash flows that you prepared from v1.  Here my review comments:

   *   Updated income taxes paid at bottom of cash flow statement – see highlight – Updated and added support received from tax department
   *   Update interest paid at bottom of cash flow statement – see highlight – Updated and linked to pull from
   *   Marketable securities – just check whether this should agree to the P&amp;L in our disclosures, probably should for presentation purposes – P&amp;L to be updated in AD. H-Cyte excluded for Marketable investment in B/S to be consistent with prior disclosure and included under prepaids.
   *   Update balance sheet figures and net income / Acc deficit for v2 – Updated for v2 entries
   *   Update the NCI column for v2 – updated to reflect final balance on NCI

Other than those minor updates and with the v2 update, looks very good, and everything ties out to supporting documents.

   Excuse me for contacting you this way, I just saw
your e-mail by chance and I thought that this e-mail will belong to the person I
should. Briefly, my name is Hans-Jürgen Heinrich, I live in France. I suffer from a serious illness which condemns me to a
certain death is throat cancer. That being said, I have a
sum of 1770,000 euros in my account with the Bank which I would like to make a donation to a trustworthy and honest person so that he can make good use of it. I own a bottle manufacturing business, and I lost my wife 6 years ago,
which affected me a lot and I have not been able to remarry until this day,
we had no children. I would like to make this sum a
gift before my death may my days be numbered for lack of this
disease for which I had no cure, but a tranquilizer here in
France. So I would like to go through your channel to do good to
deprived children.

Please contact me quickly if you are
interested in my Don, because my days are numbered.

Hi Sam,

It’s lovely to hear from you! Congratulations ☺

I’m happy to chat with you about the role! My week is fairly open:
   ••••••••• Wednesday I’m available at 10am (1pm Ontario) or 1pm (4pm Ontario)
   ••••••••• Thursday I could do 10am or 11am (1pm or 2pm in Ontario)
   ••••••••• Friday I could do 10am or 11am (1pm or 2pm in Ontario)

If none of those times suit, feel free to propose another – I picked these out of respect for the time zone difference. Shall we set up a Zoom link?

I look forward to speaking with you!

Hi Katie,

It’s been a while #128522; I hope you’re well and thriving in beautiful Victoria!

I wanted to reach out to you to ask if you’d be able to chat with me sometime over the next few weeks – I’m currently working as a Residence Life Manager at the University of Guelph in Ontario, but Olivia and I just recently got married (!) and with her graduating veterinary school this April, we are both looking to move out West #128522; I saw the posting that just went up this morning for a new Neighbourhood Manager at UVic, and I would love to chat with you as someone who works closely with the Residence Life team regarding the structure, vision, and work life of the team!

I hope you don’t mind me contacting you directly – I remember how incredibly sweet and supportive you were to me when you were an RC (seems like a lifetime ago), and I heard through the grapevine that you would be a good person to connect with regarding working at UVic.

Please let me know your thoughts #128522; looking forward to hearing your reply! P.S, I CC’d your gmail just in case the restas@uvic.ca email inbox doesn’t allow emails from outside the university!

Best wishes,

Do you like naughty women without limits?,"Thank you for your answer. I am so happy. I was thinking if you would remember me. You should as you gave me your mail and asked me to write. Nothing? Well, that doesn't matter. I am just happy you are interested. I have to be very careful, so I have joined https://bit.ly/Lotten12 . My BF is very suspecious and jealous and checks everything else I got. Had to give him password to all social medias. I just quickly made this mail to write you, as I havn't forgotten you. But join that site, so we can talk and arrange a date fast. I got same pictures and name as this mail. I am waiting for you. Baby Rose

I am really relaxed and just enjoy stuff in bed myself. Would like to find somebody like me. Then you can really live out and try new things. Just as long as there is an open communication. Love oralsex and getting my butt licked. Do you like to get your butt stimulated? There is always split opinions about a man's butt, haha. That is why I had to ask you how you feel about that, hihi. I can also tell you that I get really turned on by watching movies :-) or watching others having live sex. Something you into? Could we talk more in here https://bit.ly/Abby117 ? I seldom check my mail so it is just much better to get in touch on the page, and then we can take it from there. Lillyfee

you will be withdrawing money with it and always send my own

Good Day,

I am sure that covid19 has impacted normal outreach efforts for both the UVIC and the student.

Our son is 17 years old, Ahousaht and has been struggling. Fortunately he is at home and thus we have been able to intervene. That said, we are not in-sync with best practices for an indigenous student at UVIC.

Mark has been in contact with the good people at the BCOM Advisors office...THANKS.

Mark tells us that he has not received any support from the good people at the UVIC First Peoples House. To us, this would look like UVIC reaching out to a first year student who is indigenous and developing a relationship that is perhaps even a weekly engagement?

We mean no disrespect, our son's education is important to him, us and our community.

Kleco Kleco for considering our words as caring, helpful and respectful to one another.

"Your website, databases and emails has been hacked.","Notice: This message was sent from outside the University of Victoria email system but is claiming to be from UVic. Please be cautious with links, attachments, and sensitive information.


Notice: This message was sent from outside the University of Victoria email system. Please be cautious with links and sensitive information.




FORWARD THIS EMAIL TO THE PERSON WITHIN YOUR COMPANY WHO MAKES THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS

You may have noticed that we are using your company's server to send this message, we have hacked into your https://www.uvic.ca site and extracted all of your databases and backed up all of your mailboxes.

How did this happen?

Our team found several vulnerabilities within your website and company computers that we were able to exploit. After finding them, we were able to obtain their database credentials and extract their complete data from their computers, from their site and copies of all emails in all their mailboxes with uvic.ca domain and finally we moved the information to a foreign server.

What does this mean?

We will systematically go through a series of steps to totally damage your reputation. First, your database will be leaked or sold to the highest bidder to be used for any purpose. Next, emails will be sent to all your customers, suppliers and business partners, stating that all of their information has been sold or leaked and your https://www.uvic.ca site was at fault for leaking the information and damaging the reputation of all your customers and providers. Lastly, any links you have indexed in search engines will be de-indexed based on the blackhat techniques we used in the past to de-index our targets, not to mention getting your business on every blacklist in the country.

How do I stop this?

We are willing to forget about destroying the reputation of your site and company for a small fee. The current fee is $2,500 USD in Bitcoins.

Send the amount in Bitcoin to the following address:

3Fyjqj5WutzSVJ8DnKrLgZFEAxVz6Pddn7

Once you have made your payment, we will automatically be informed of it. At the precise moment that you have read this message, you have a period of 72 hours to make the payment, or I guarantee that the reputation of your company will be completely destroyed. The proof that we have access and all your data is that this message has been sent using your company's servers.

How do I get Bitcoins?

You can easily buy bitcoins through various websites.

What happens if I don't pay?

If you decide not to pay, we will launch the attack after 72 hours and keep it until you do, there is no countermeasure to this, you will just end up wasting more money trying to find a solution. We will completely destroy your reputation with your customers, your suppliers, your partners, on google and the entire country.

This is not a hoax, do not try to reason or negotiate, we will not read any answers. Once you've paid, we'll stop what we were doing, we'll destroy all data taken from your site, your databases, your mailboxes, and you'll never hear from us again.

Keep in mind that the payment with Bitcoin is anonymous and no one will know that you have complied. The time is running.

Next week, March 4-7th 2021, the University of Hawai’i is virtually hosting the 7th International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation. As you may already know, this conference happens every 2 years and is the largest conference in our field. Even though it’s online this year it looks like it is going to be a great conference with some excellent presentations and workshops. All of the pre-recorded presentations will be available for anyone to view on YouTube but only those who are registered for the conference will be able to participate in the live sessions and workshops. For more information please see the schedule here: http://ling.lll.hawaii.edu/sites/icldc/program/

We apologize for the late notice since many of you have already registered for the conference, however we would like to offer to pay for up to 2 registrations for each partner. If you, or someone from your organization or one of your elders, have not registered yet and would like to attend please let me know by Friday March 26th at 5pm PST by sending the following information for each registrant:

         1.       Full Name
         2.       Institution or affiliation
         3.       Email address
         4.       Registration type (student, non-university affiliated, or university-affiliated)

MY PREVIOUS SUCH MESSAGE TO YOU,"
Dear   recipient,


On Monday, August 22, 2022 at 10:26:26 AM PDT, IOAN DIRINA &lt;sdluser@yahoo.com&gt; wrote a comment to you about invasion of our country by people coming from Third World countries,and a portion of it had been deleted by error;you can read that part also now in next paragraph if you so desire:


The good news is that,there will be no difference in our country and the second rate countries these people are fleeing.No point to applying for asylum after that ! We'll all be exactly the same.The bad news is,there will be no country left where Americans can seek asylum.


                                  With anticipated thanks,Ioan Dirina,author

Dear Victoria Compounding Pharmacy,

In the undergraduate labs at UVic, we use some analgesics capsules for an experiment and would like to use your compounding service.

To limit wastage, we would like to order as many capsules as necessary to consume as much of the reagents as possible. The masses per capsule below should match what you previously prepared for us on December 14, 17 and 18th of 2018 and Dec 9th of 2019.

- type of capsule: gel

- size of capsule: # 1 or # 0

- no cellulose filler

 Unknown #2 - 220 mg ASA &#43; 220 mg Phenacetin = 440 mg/capsule (1800 capsules)

Unknown #3 - 391.5 mg Caffeine &#43; 43.5 mg Phenacetin = 435 mg/capsule (2000 capsules)

This would leave some excess of caffeine and ASA and completely used up the phenacetin. This calculation is based on perfection (ie. No spills or loss due to transfers) which we aren’t expecting. Please just make as close to these numbers as you reasonably can.

All 3 chemicals will be provided to you and they will be used for teaching only and are not for human or animal consumption. I can drop off these chemicals myself. Please save and return any remaining chemicals.

Please call Alivia Wang (250-472-5142) if you have any questions or e-mail me at

For credit card payment:

Please call Rob Iuval at UVic Science Stores: 250-721-7190

Or if he in unavailable, use the general UVic Science Stores phone line: 250-721-8853

Hi Sam,

It’s lovely to hear from you! Congratulations ☺

I’m happy to chat with you about the role! My week is fairly open:
   ••••••••• Wednesday I’m available at 10am (1pm Ontario) or 1pm (4pm Ontario)
   ••••••••• Thursday I could do 10am or 11am (1pm or 2pm in Ontario)
   ••••••••• Friday I could do 10am or 11am (1pm or 2pm in Ontario)

If none of those times suit, feel free to propose another – I picked these out of respect for the time zone difference. Shall we set up a Zoom link?

I look forward to speaking with you!

Hi Katie,

It’s been a while &#128522; I hope you’re well and thriving in beautiful Victoria!

I wanted to reach out to you to ask if you’d be able to chat with me sometime over the next few weeks – I’m currently working as a Residence Life Manager at the University of Guelph in Ontario, but Olivia and I just recently got married (!) and with her graduating veterinary school this April, we are both looking to move out West &#128522; I saw the posting that just went up this morning for a new Neighbourhood Manager at UVic, and I would love to chat with you as someone who works closely with the Residence Life team regarding the structure, vision, and work life of the team!

I hope you don’t mind me contacting you directly – I remember how incredibly sweet and supportive you were to me when you were an RC (seems like a lifetime ago), and I heard through the grapevine that you would be a good person to connect with regarding working at UVic.

Please let me know your thoughts &#128522; looking forward to hearing your reply! P.S, I CC’d your gmail just in case the restas@uvic.ca email inbox doesn’t allow emails from outside the university!

Best wishes,

Dear Victoria Compounding Pharmacy,

In the undergraduate labs at UVic, we use some analgesics capsules for an experiment and would like to use your compounding service.

To limit wastage, we would like to order as many capsules as necessary to consume as much of the reagents as possible. The masses per capsule below should match what you previously prepared for us on December 14, 17 and 18th of 2018 and Dec 9th of 2019.

- type of capsule: gel

- size of capsule: # 1 or # 0

- no cellulose filler

 Unknown #2 - 220 mg ASA &#43; 220 mg Phenacetin = 440 mg/capsule (1800 capsules)

Unknown #3 - 391.5 mg Caffeine &#43; 43.5 mg Phenacetin = 435 mg/capsule (2000 capsules)

This would leave some excess of caffeine and ASA and completely used up the phenacetin. This calculation is based on perfection (ie. No spills or loss due to transfers) which we aren’t expecting. Please just make as close to these numbers as you reasonably can.

All 3 chemicals will be provided to you and they will be used for teaching only and are not for human or animal consumption. I can drop off these chemicals myself. Please save and return any remaining chemicals.

Please call Alivia Wang (250-472-5142) if you have any questions or e-mail me at

For credit card payment:

Please call Rob Iuval at UVic Science Stores: 250-721-7190

Or if he in unavailable, use the general UVic Science Stores phone line: 250-721-8853

Thank you,

Hi Colin,

You do not need that information. Part 1 is based on what happened.

The assignment notes “ …using the failure modes that took place at each structure.” So you only look at the consequence classification based on the failure that actually happened. No other failure modes. All info should be in the investigation reports.

This may sound odd, but you may be interested.

I am not sure if either of you is a Dodger fan, but I have a box for the game on October 1.  Unfortunately, I can’t be there for the game, but I am still looking for interested clients to attend.  Other K&amp;L attorneys (George) and clients will be there.  Let me know if you’d be interested.

"Waterloo University $5,000,000 Corruption Scandal","
Dear Sir or Madam;
This is a long message due to its importance. Thank you for reading it!

I am the witness to a hoax research project (the hoax project) conducted at the School of Computer Science (&quot;the School&quot;), University of Waterloo (UW or &quot;the University&quot;). The hoax project continued from 2010 to 2015 while I worked as PhD researcher from January 2011 till April 2014. My supervisor was Professor Paulo Alencar while Professor Donald Cowan was a co-supervisor and my salary provider. I worked with these professors for more than 3 years without knowing that they were not regular employees of the University and not even eligible to supervise a PhD student. I experienced several professional misconducts from my supervisor and requested the School Administration but they refused to help.
Around April of 2014, I discovered that my supervisors were working on a mega research project allocated more than $5,000,000. Professor Cowan was the principal investigator while Professor Alencar was a co-investigator. I never knew that they were working on some research project and concluded that my supervisors were exploiting the reputation of the University for unethical personal gains. I informed the School Administration and refused to work with my supervisors. The University was a guarantor for the successful completion of the project partnered with the Government of Ontario. The University was responsible for investigating research misconducts including misrepresentations and mismanagement of funds associated with the hoax project. However, it did not follow its own policies and guidelines and did no investigations.
In May 2014, Professor Martin Karsten, a regular faculty member at the School, was appointed my new supervisor. No investigation about the conduct of the previous supervisors was done. Two faculty members, Professor David Taylor (former school director) and Professor Bernard Wong became my committee members. Professor Karsten put the condition of passing the PhD proposal exam to continue receiving supervision from him. His demoralizing, taunting, and insulting attitude in emails and one-on-one meetings kept me under pressure always. He breached the IP policy of the University sharing my confidential research writing. Meanwhile, I felt intellectually deteriorated and unfocused while working in my UW office due to a strange health condition never experienced  before. It was brain hypoxia (oxygen starvation to the brain). I also experienced sudden hard breath during field hockey games. It was due to intestinal hypoxia which was never faced before. I had good health. I did never feel brain hypoxia while working at home where I started spending most of my productive hours. Professor Karsten, an expert in my research area, resigned from the supervision after I passed the proposal exam in June 2015. He formally explained that I ignored his research instructions and guidelines, and was doing some immature research. He gave &quot;sincere recommendation&quot; to terminate PhD studies to look for a job. The University started pushing me to withdraw because of having no supervisor. Meanwhile, I claimed a major research breakthrough. A well-known professor of University of Toronto agreed to supervise me after my invited research talk there. However, UW required a local supervisor at UW first to continue PhD while no UW faculty member agreed to supervise me. I was unaware that UW had policies and guidelines to handle issues associated with graduate research supervision, public/private research funding.
In March 2016, I filed a grievance for internal hearing. The reply of UW had several misrepresentations and twisted texts. I learned that Professor Alencar, an ad-hoc researcher who supervised me for more than 3 years, was not my supervisor. No information about my real supervisor was disclosed. In July 2016, UW terminated my enrollment because of not having a supervisor. I accumulated more than $58,000 student loan to feed my family during the 6 years of PhD. My career was practically finished. In January 2019, I discovered that Professor Cowan, the principal investigator of the hoax project, was in fact my supervisor. I never discussed my research with him in a meeting or email during my PhD at the School.
The Resignation of Professor Karsten and the University's repeated demand to withdraw mounted much more pressure on me. I started having chest pain in and around my heart in July or August 2015 when unknowingly facing abnormal cardiac rhythm. High BP and fast heartbeat in stress became part of my life. In January 2016, I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. I visited 4 hospitals in the next 7 months for medical relief but the health professionals prepared misleading notes to eliminate cardiac and mental health issues. They falsely documented that I was overweight, had high triglycerides due to unhealthy eating habits, and the chest pain was due to hypertension or chest muscles. After waiting for 9 months to get access to a psychiatrist, I left Canada in October 2016 for health treatment in Pakistan. I stayed in Pakistan for 13 months and was initially diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety.
I was under surveillance by my siblings, in-laws, and friends in Pakistan. Invisible electronic devices were installed in my family home and my cell phone was also hacked. UW gave me an offer through my in-laws to settle the issue. This increased my sense of insecurity and helplessness while living among loved ones in Pakistan. Cardiologist in Pakistan also falsely documented that I had hypertension, eating disorders, and pain in chest muscles. I secretly visited a psychologist and my chest pain was temporarily cured. Thanks to the un-computerized health system of Pakistan. I visited many lawyers in Pakistan but no one agreed to help me understand my case against UW. I learned that a high-profile intelligence agency led by a former chief of the Pakistan Armed Forces was monitoring my activities. It was getting instructions from Canada.
I returned to Canada in November 2017 after arranging funds to hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit against UW. However, no lawyer agreed to help me. The chest pain came back although I was on medications. I quit the medications (antidepressants) to study the laws and rules of Ontario Courts to file a lawsuit as self-represented. I had no law background and English was my second language. I filed a lawsuit against UW in May 2018 claiming $209,000,000 in damages. I made several attempts to bring a motion for judicial direction but could not get my motion papers filed at Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) Kitchener. UW brought a motion to strike the claim. No legal help, no understanding and knowledge of the law, not knowing undocumented court procedures, and my poor physical and mental health gave every benefit to UW in the courtroom. UW was granted the motion and I decided to file an appeal. During this whole process, I discovered that UW defrauded the court (SCJ) and also filed a false affidavit. I needed help to move further but no help was available. My motions for leave to appeal were dismissed by Divisional Court Toronto due to the deficient Orders which UW got issued from SCJ Kitchener. The appeal process halted. I tried to bring a motion for judicial direction at Divisional Court Toronto because it was the only help window opened for me. However, the court staff did not allow it. I contacted newspapers, members of provincial and federal parliaments, and prominent journalists for help but to no avail. In January 2020, I decided to go public.
I never had considerable health issues until the discovery of the UW hoax project. In 2018, my health records, mainly from UW Health Services during PhD, were replaced by fake health records in my bedroom in Brampton. The fake health records show that I have a history of abdominal pain since 2009 with a number of functional gastrointestinal diseases and hypertension. This would mean that I had an unhealthy lifestyle with Metabolic Syndrome at the initial stage. Unknowingly, I took the fake health records to a family doctor for understanding but she put them in my file. Later on, those fake records were sent to a cardiologist who I visited for cardiac health assessment. The cardiologist conducted tests to measure oxygen flow to the brain and the renal health without information and sharing results. When my abnormal cardiac rhythm became worse during the appeal filing process at Divisional Court Toronto in 2019, my family doctor unnecessarily fed me anti-depressants before sending for another cardiac assessment. I intentionally missed the appointment after knowing that my cardiac symptoms were included in the side-effects of the prescribed antidepressants. I started having issues with kidneys but unwillingly had to consult the same family doctor because another doctor refused to provide healthcare. The family doctor again wrote a fake note on an ultrasound requisition which I did not do fearing the implications of the false note. In September 2020, I forwarded the fake health records to the Ministry of Health (MoH) (a partner in the UW hoax project), and Office of the Ontario Premier. MoH cancelled my health coverage upon my request.
My body has been hijacked using bi-agent chemicals (BAC). BAC is a multi-layer biological framework which can create any symptoms/diseases in a selected person without affecting others. BAC is injected in two steps: (i) a first agent chemical is injected into the body of the selected person only, to make him/her a target, (ii) multiple second agent chemicals are injected into the body of the target to react with the first agent chemical for creating desired health symptoms/diseases without affecting others. Normally, the second agent chemicals leave the body after creating desired health effects and diseases, which might make their detection difficult. BAC can impair medical exams and lab tests of the target. It can inject real diseases and transform them into chronic stages in hours. This understanding is based on personal experiences. Major doses of the first BAC agents were injected in my body in January/February 2020 when I started working on making UW hoax project information public. Since then, more than a thousand attacks have been conducted on my body using different BAC (second agents) to prove that I have gastrointestinal diseases, impaired cognition, cardiac health issues, hypertension, body fat, muscle weaknesses, brain hypoxia, and intestinal hypoxia. The main objective is to establish that I have increased Metabolic Syndrome disease developed due to clustering conditions including abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high triglycerides.
BAC are injected into my body using different means including foods/liquids, indoor/outdoor environments, air-conditioning/heating-system/tap-water, personal vehicle, public transports, and medical/public facilities. In September/October 2020, more than 7 KG fat was added on my belly creating abdominal obesity within 16 days during sleep hours. Next, fat was added on the waistlines in parallel to destroy my intestines, slowly. After &quot;creating&quot; symptoms for more than a year, BAC entered certain real diseases in my body, one of them is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS could cause intestinal hypoxia and brain hypoxia, proving the presence of Metabolic Syndrome. However, the decisive element to confirm Metabolic Syndrome is fat on buttocks, waistline, and belly. From June 2022, BAC is used to add more fat aggressively on covered areas of my body including belly, waistlines, buttocks, under arms, thighs, ribs, abdomen, waist, chest, under belly area, shoulders, knees, and back. All these fats will formally prove (by definition) that I have Metabolic Syndrome. Although fat adds weight to the body, BAC is used to keep my weight normal by increasing persistent dehydration, depleting muscle energy (glycogen), and draining certain nutrients. My current physical appearance and weight are almost the same as when I was a PhD student at UW. BAC is used to make my face thin, a typical sign of brain hypoxia, while I had a normal facial appearance when I studied at UW. This intuitively means two things: (i) I had a lot of fat on my body although my weight was normal when I studied at UW, (ii) brain hypoxia developed later due to unhealthy lifestyle and increased Metabolic Syndrome over the last 7-8 years. The fake records indicate that I have a history of diseases leading to Metabolic Syndrome, did not care about the treatments and instructions, and continued my unhealthy lifestyle. BAC-triggered elevation of lipids, triglycerides, liver issues, and destroyed gut will further prove increased Metabolic Syndrome. Lab exams will prove these conditions as biological evidence has been injected in my body. Metabolic Syndrome shows high risk of developing abnormal cardiac rhythm and Type 2 diabetes. As I have abnormal cardiac rhythm and insulin resistance, it will be tried to prove that whatever happened to me is my own fault. I need access to my true health records to prove that I was a normal person before reporting the hoax project at UW and that effects of Metabolic Syndrome on my body are created artificially.
In April 2021, I informed police about the UW scandal, BAC, and the elements involved. The police refused to help.
I am self-represented in 3 Ontario Courts including a divorce Application in Family Court accepted on October 27, 2021. I pleaded to Family Court to allow me to move my kids to Pakistan to be taken care of at home of their paternal grandparents until the issue with UW is resolved. I have been unemployed since May 2016 and trying to sell assets in Pakistan to show that I have funds to take care of my children. I bought it before coming to Canada. On March 9, 2022, the earliest available case conference date with Family Court was April 25, 2022. I brought an urgent motion in-writing on April 5, 2022, to request for an early date for a case conference and expeditious processing of the Application. I could not get relief. On April 13, 2022, it was decided that the first case conference will be held on January 18, 2023 (more than a year after filing of the Application). I fear that BAC generated irritation and hypertension can cause me serious troubles in the domestic environment anytime (we live in a basement with the Landlords living the Upstairs). In response to any unpleasant incident, the lawyer of the Respondent will bring an urgent motion in Family Court which might result in my mental and physical health evaluation under the Court Order, and a decision will be issued accordingly. This will cause prejudice to me as biological evidence of metabolic syndrome has been injected into my body and lab evaluation will prove that I have the disease. In addition, I expect to face several witnesses in the Courts for multiple associated events in these matters. I need access to my true health records to defend myself. Proving metabolic syndrome will impact on the lawsuit against UW because the disease causes brain and intestinal hypoxia, and abnormal cardiac rhythm. Due to these circumstances, I divorced the Respondent on August 11 under the Islamic Divorce Law. I am obliged to leave the home after the process is complete within 45 days. Children will stay with the Respondent until the custody decision by Family Court, Brampton, which is expected in the next 3 -4 years.I resumed peaceful protest in Brampton on August 18, 2022, and aim to extend to other GTA areas soon. The frequency of BAC attacks has increased since then showing two major symptoms: (1) elevation of blood pressure for longer duration, particularly during sleep hours and early mornings; (2) more fats and draining of nutrients as evidence of increased metabolic syndrome. It seems that BAC are slowly injecting inflammation in tissues of the legs, which might cause pains in the muscles and joints. This will be visible evidence of increased metabolic syndrome during public protests. On March 2, 2022, I wrote a letter to the Prime Ministers of Pakistan and Canada for help. I did not receive a reply. The letter, along with recent updates is available on Reddit forum under the Subject of this message.

Muhammad Shafique

Urgent Please respond as soon as you can,"Notice: This message was sent from outside the University of Victoria email system. Please be cautious with links and sensitive information.


I'm sorry for this odd request because it might get to you too urgent because of the situation of things right now.


I'm stuck in London, England with my family right now, we are here on a short break for my leave and was robbed, worse of it is that bags, cash, cards with my cell phone was stolen at Gun point, it was such a crazy experience for us and we need help flying back home, the authorities are not being 100% supportive but the good thing is we still have our passports and return ticket but currently having troubles paying off the hotel bills and also getting a cab to take us to the airport.


All we need is $1850.00 but anything you can spare right now will be appreciated and I promise to refund it to you as soon as I arrive back home safely. You have my word!!

My dear friend,

How are you today?  I understand you may not remember me again, but I contacted you previously about a business transaction, don't know if you will remember. Actually, you agreed to help me then but later
opted-out. Well, I was able to successfully transfer the funds to another business partner that helped me. At the same time I want to use this opportunity to say that I did not forget your past effort and
attempts to assist me then, now I'm happy to inform you that I have succeeded in getting those funds transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from Maryland, United States.

I decided to compensate you with the sum of $450,000.00 as my little appreciation for your effort and all the stress that you went through during that period of time. Please I want you to kindly get in contact
with my personal secretary Miss. alvan pinto, through this
e-mail address
alvan_pinto@yahoo.com<mailto:alvan_pinto@yahoo.com>
and tell her to send you the cheque of $450,000.00  which I keep with her for your compensation for all the
effort you made to assist me during that difficult times because without you it would have not been possible for me and the new partner
to successfully got the money. So feel free to get in contact with my secretary immediately and send her your details so that she can send
you the cheque.

And please do not forget to let me know immediately when you receive the cheque so that we can share the joy together. This moment, I am
very busy with my partner at the moment because of the current investment projects that we are currently working together on.

Regards,

Mr.

Hello David,


Can you update the details on my payroll account? I was alerted for suspicious activity from my bank and my bank details have been updated. I need my payroll account updated with my new details. Can I send the Void Check document for this? Can it be effective for the current pay cycle?

Here is the last warning! Your information has been compromised! The entry in system is completed.,"Notice: This message was sent from outside the University of Victoria email system. Please be cautious with links and sensitive information.


I got  terrible information just for  you. Earlier I  got  access to your systems.


After  that,  I began  keeping track of  your activity.
I  mounted  a Trojan  on the  operating systems  of all systems  that you  use to get  into  the online  world.


The following program offers  me connection to  all  of your  devices.
I have  downloaded your  whole info,  pictures, and  browsing record  to my servers.


I got  access to  all  your files,  interaction  messengers, social  network, connections, e-mail etc.
My  computer virus updates  fingerprints &  stays hidden  to anti-virus software.



While  collecting info  on you,  I found that  you are a  big admirer  of grownup  websites  and  are also  watching exciting  clips  while going  through a  huge  amount of fun.
I  was capable to  capture some  of  your filthy  moments when you  jack off and  reach orgasm.




If  you have any  skepticism, I am  able to  generate  a couple of  clicks  and all  videos  will be revealed  to everybody  you know.



Plus I  can post  all your  messages, personal  images, and your  private information  on the  Internet.





I  can wreck your  reputation forever.

I do  think you actually  do not  want this  to take  place, given the  character of  the video  you  like  to watch, do  you know  what I am  talking  about, it will  likely be  a  true  disaster for  you.

Now let's fix  that by doing  this:  you transfer  me 1300  $ (in  btc corresponding to  the swap  rate at  the time  of  transfer),  and I'll immediately  erase everything. After  that,  we'll forget  about one another. Furthermore  , i promise  to disconnect  and get  rid of  all trojans  from your  devices.

Do  not forget  that I usually  hold my  own word. Here  is  my btc  wallet: bc1qndrgr9afyf0ptn4kyxtqrdx6ckhf7m8d3wa5k8


You  have  Two business  days from  the moment  you view  this particular  e mail.


If  you do  not forward  cash, your  videos  and all  computer data will  be  posted online for  all individuals  as  well as  your loved  ones. I  will  destroy your  reputation  eternally.



Don't  seek me  and don't  contact law enforcement  along  with other  help,  otherwise  your  info will  be  posted.


I  am  aware of  a lot  of secrets about who  you are, so  if your  reputation is  valuable, keep in  mind that  I can damage  it once  and for  all.

Hi  There.



This is  your very  last notice.




I got into  your system thru  the Wi-Fi router  you were  linking to.

A few  months prior,  I gotten  to  the devices  that you  previously used  to get  on the  net.





All of  the  data from  your  electronics and  devices  was  quickly replicated  to my  hosting space.





I  can  take advantage  of  all your  mobile  phone messengers,  social  networking sites,  email messages,  chat history,  and list  of contacts. My  malware  continuously changes  its signatures (driver based),  for that reason  it stays  not visible  to anti-malware  software.

I  assume  at  this point  you realize,  why  I stayed  unseen right  until today

Whilst  gathering infos  in regards  to you, I  discovered you  happen to  be  a huge  fan of  mature web sites  & more. You  actually like  to stop by  porno web sites  and look  at kinky  video clips  while getting an  orgasm.


I  have already  made a  webcam capturing videos  of you  jacking off.  A montage  of the  video  you were  seeing right  at that  moment &  your genital  masturbation.


Your  own happy  face is  clearly seeable.  I do  not believe this  particular material  will be really  good for  your personal  reputation.



I  can  certainly send  this video out  to every  person who  know  your identity.
I additionally have  no trouble  with  making all your  discreet information  open public  on the  Internet.


I  think you  realize  what I'm talking  about.
It  could be an  absolute frustration  for you.




I  can mess  up your daily  life for  a long  time.



I think  you  do  not need  that to  happen.




Why  don't we fix  it that  way: you  send me  1500 $  (dollars)  using Bitcoin  equivalent at  the time  of payment), and  i'll  right away  get  rid of  all  of your  info from  my web  servers. And  then, we  will forget  about  each  other.





My btc  transaction  address  for transfer:  bc1q7q4xzdxvqp8uxhpmv8xpkunzutm0zxzcq5fd0v

***SPAM Suspected*** hello,"My Dear Friend,

My Name is Mr.Charles Patrick Beal; I am from the United States of
America. I know that this message will be a surprise to you. Firstly,
I am married to Mrs.lilian Beal, A gold merchant who owns a small gold
Mine in Syria; she died of Cardiovascular Disease in mid-March 2011.
During his lifetime he deposited the sum of € 8.5 Million Euro) Eight
million, Five hundred thousand Euros in a bank in Ouagadougou the
capital city of Burkina Faso in West Africa. The deposited money was
from the sale of the shares, death benefits payment and entitlements
of my deceased wife by her company.

I am sending this message to you praying that it will reach you in
good health, since I am not in good health in which I sleep every
night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day.

I have been suffering from cancer for a long time and presently I am
partially suffering from a stroke illness which has become almost
impossible for me to move around. I was married to my late wife for
over 4 years before he died and unfortunately that we don't have a
child, my doctor confided in me that i have less chance to live.
Having known my health condition, I decided to contact you to claim
the fund since I don't have any relation; I grew up from the orphanage
home,

I have decided to donate what I have to you for the support of helping
Motherless babies/Less privileged/Widows' because I am dying and
diagnosed with cancer about 2 years ago. I have been touched by God
Almighty to donate from what I have inherited from my late wife to you
for the good work of God Almighty. I have asked Almighty God to
forgive me and believe he has, because He is a Merciful God, I will be
going in for an operation soon.

This is the reason I need your services to stand as my next of kin or
an executor to claim the funds for charity purposes. If this money
remains unclaimed after my death, the bank executives or the
government will take the money as unclaimed fund and maybe use it for
selfish and worthless ventures, I need a very honest person who can
claim this money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages, widows
and also build schools for less privilege that will be named after my
late wife  and my name; I need your urgent answer to know if you will
be able to execute this project, and I will give you more information
on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account.

Thanks,
Mr.Charles Patrick,

Hello Dear,

I am Mrs. Noémie Ethan Raphael, married to the late Mr. Ethan Raphael, who was a businessman and a politician here. Before his sudden death we deposited the sum of $4.6 million dollars in one of the leading banks here.

I am very sick and diagnosed, so I decided to donate this fund to an honest person. My objective is to support old people, vulnerable and abandoned children, my goal is to support those less privileged and to fulfil the vow i made with my late husband.

I will give you more details as soon as I hear from you. Your urgent response is very important because of my health condition.

Mrs. Noémie Ethan Raphael.

***SPAM Suspected*** Re: TREAT AS CONFIDENTIAL..,"--
Hello,

I'm Francois Petit with Societe Generale Bank here in France. I
sincerely seek to present you as the Next of Kin to a late client who
left behind $145.5 million dollars in a fixed deposit account in my
bank before his demise.

The British born client was into Diamond and Gold mining and died
without a Next of Kin. I shall obtain the legal documents that will
give you legal rights to make this claim legitimately. I am willing to
share the funds 60/40 with you and this will be completed within 72
hours. With the legal documents, the bank will approve you as the Next
of Kin and pay out this amount to you within three working days. I
considered the funds would be of better use to both of us instead of
allowing corrupt politicians to confiscate the funds.

Please reach me as soon as possible with your full name, address,
direct contact number and occupation for the processing of the legal
documents if you are interested and can be trusted to return my own
share when you have received the funds in your bank account. More
information shall be given to you once I hear from you.

However, if you are not interested in the offer, kindly delete this
message from your mailbox and pretend that I never contacted you. I'll
continue my search for a liable person that will help out.

Best Wishes,
Francois Petit

***SPAM Suspected*** An Overdue Inheritance Fund.,"Greetings My Friend,

I am Mrs. Peng Xiao, I work with a bank here in China as head of the audit department. During our bank general account auditing I discovered an overdue fund worth millions of Dollars belonging to my late customer who died over 13 years ago leaving nobody to inherit his funds.

I am contacting you that we may have an agreement on this, and this is the best time to execute such a deal due to the Pandemic situation here in China right now, note 50% of the sum will be for you while the other 50% will be my share as well.

I will be waiting for your quick response in order to update you with full detail.


Yours Sincerely,
Mrs. Peng Xiao.

How are you doing and work? I emailed few weeks ago without any response from you. I sent you a business proposal that is of high interest and 100% risk free. Its all about the Russian Ukraine invasion which has led to the death of one of our great investor and coincidentally you are in a position to work with me in getting some of the undisclosed investment deposit cleared.

I will give you further details upon your response.

Thanks

Peace be unto you.

My Name is Revi Eissa from Afghanistan, a politician and government
official working with the ministry of finance before the Taliban’s
took control of Afghanistan. I plead for your help to receive and
secure my luggage in your country.

I want to send out my digital safe box containing my life savings,
Three million six hundred thousand dollars and some of my very
important documents through diplomatic delivery from Afghanistan to
your country for security reasons and for investment in your country.
Unfortunately, I cannot send the money through the bank because the
Taliban’s have taken control of all the institutions in Afghanistan.
We are under imminent threat from massacres and targeted executions of
government officials since the Taliban’s returned to power in our
country and I have been in hiding to avoid the risk of deadly
reprisals by the Taliban’s as I wait for paperwork to evacuate with my
family.

I hope to hear from you through email [ eissaravi@gmail.com ] for my
safety because the Taliban’s are tracking calls to find out our exact
location in Kabul. For the delivery to your country, please send me

Attention: Sir

A clarion call from a distressed Investor in Afghanistan. My Principal became distressed following the abrupt take-over of Kabul by the Taliban

Business operations have stopped as foreign reserves of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), the central bank, have all been frozen. My principal, as a prominent member of the defunct Islamic Republic, wishes to immediately relocate her financial funds which were quickly moved to a nearby country. Funds are ready to be re-invested.

I am open for more confidential discussion.

Hi
",,
Email to you with the help of my private female nurse,"            Dearest one, how are you doing today?

however is not  mandatory nor  will I in any manner compel you to honor against your  will.  Mrs.Mary josen from Northern Ireland, 68 years old   .
I married to  Mr. Daniel josen  who worked with the Canadian Embassy here in Cote d’Ivoire for nine years before he died  in the year  2014 .

Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since  his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my  matrimonial home which the Bible is against.
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of  4,500,000.00 EURO  in  a bank .

Recently, my DOCTOR told me that I would not last for the  next Eight months due to cancer problems. Having known my  condition I decided to donate this fund to an Orphanage  or good Christian that will utilize this money the way I am  going to instruct here.
I want an organization or good person that will use  this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of  God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.

l made this decision because I don't have any children that  will inherit this money. and my husband's relatives are not  Christians not even good at all because they are the one  that killed my husband in order to have all my late husband's properties and I don't want my husband's efforts to  be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where  this money will be used in an ungodly way.
This is why I am making this decision. I am not afraid of  death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going  to be in the bosom of the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  ""the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my  peace"".
With God all things are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact  of the Bank . I will also issue you an authority letter that  will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund. I want  you to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd.
My happiness is that I lived the life of a worthy  Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve  him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all  through your life.
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated  here.

Hoping to receive your response immediately.

Thanks and Remain blessed in the Lord.

Mrs, Mary josen

Trevor,

A $100 paid study on business risk outlook for 2022 - is this something you'd be interested in? If yes, my market research company is looking to hear from compliance, legal or risk professionals like you. We're running an online, anonymous survey to learn more about how risk, legal and compliance factor in business decision making in 2022. We're working on this with a market research firm and I think you'd be a great fit to share your thoughts. The survey takes about 25 minutes to complete. We pay via a variety of methods, such as virtual Visa or MasterCard, iTunes or other gift cards, donation to a charity of your choice, etc

If this sounds interesting to you, let me know and I'll send a survey link. I'm also happy to answer any questions.

***SPAM Suspected*** My dear Friend and Beloved,"My dear Friend and Beloved,

With warm hearts and joy in the Lord Jesus, I write this mail to you. I am
Ms Renate Settnik, a German Citizen,but living in Burkina Faso. I am a
Widow. I am 67 years old, without any child.

I am a devoted Christian and have the fear of God. I am a philanthropist
and a care-giver. I inherited the sum of 25 million Euro from my late
husband who was a Crude Oil dealer before he was killed during the Burkina
Faso Political unrest that happened Four years ago
in August 2016.

Due to his death, that resulted me to too much stress and tension, thereby
causing me to contract Paralysis.

What worries me is that I am down with FULL-BODY PARALYSIS. I cannot walk,
nor stand. I have been bedridden for Three years now.

Since I know that I have very limited time to stay on earth before I die
according to my Doctors, I have been helping and contributing some amounts
of money to Orphanage Homes and to Charity Organizations, as well as
Foundations.

With the help of the Bishop of the Catholic church where I worship, I have
given donations to over 10 Charity Organizations and Foundations, in
Africa,Asia, South America, etc.

From findings, your Charity Foundation was listed among the remaining to be
given donations, I will be giving you the token sum of € 850 Thousand Euro

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the
Catholic Bishop where you will send him your bank details and other
requirements he may need from you .I want you and the church to always pray
for me.

Get back to me if you are interested and ready to handle this transaction
for charity work.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Best regards,
Mrs.Renate Magdalena Settnik.

***SPAM Suspected*** Greetings my dear,"Greetings, my dear

I am writing to you based on trust. My name is Mrs.Janneth George, My
late husband deals in Crude Oil with the Federal Government of Sudan
and we have a personal Oil firm in Bentiu Oil zone town and Upper Nile
city.

What I have experience physically, I don't wish to experience it again
in my life due to the recent civil Ethnic crises caused by our
President Mr. Salva Kiir and the rebel leader Dr. Riek Machar, I'm
refugee camp in Chad to save my life and that of my little daughter.

I want to solicit for your partnership with trust to transfer and
invest the sum of (Ten million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds
Sterling) deposited by my late husband to your country, because my
life is no longer safe in our country, since the rebels are looking
for the families of all the oil business men in the country to kill,
saying that they are the people that is milking the country dry.

Let me know if you are willing and capable of assisting us in getting
this fund transferred to your bank account so that I can give you more
information on how to get in contact with the bank where my late
husband deposited this fund when he was alive.

With love from

Mrs Janneth George

Intending beneficiaries must have a business plan and show their

***SPAM Suspected*** ARE YOU INTERESTED...??,"Hi my friend, I'm Mrs Qin. I work in a bank. Please excuse my english, if there are errors! First off, if we both survived the Covid-19 epidemic out break, then I believe that God has given each of us all a chance to do better and help humanity. Well, as a banker, I have a 100 percent guaranteed opportunity we can profit from without having to hurt anybody. We can both support the less privileged financially, and also our families in a very legal and risk free way. I have a deal worth a substantial amount of money, and I wish for us to partner together to accomplish it. Currently; I’m in total control of a dormant escrow account and the customer is deceased. But, that notwithstanding, my lawyer can appoint you as a relative to our deceased customer and have all his deposits directed to you as the next of kin without creating any problem for us. It will only take a little time to get the Paper-Works ready and once they are ready, then we are good to go. I can easily arrange this because our deceased customer recorded no next of kin. He opened his escrow account with our private banking department and my official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise and monitor the account. I hope you understand that rare opportunities like this only come one's way once in a lifetime? I mean, I cannot let this chance pass me by and I hope you understand because for once I found myself in total control and face to face with my destiny. These chances won't pass me by. I am a family woman and this is an occasion for me to provide them with new opportunities and a good life and also to help the less privileged. A maximum of fifty (50) percent may be offered as your share for being my partner. Therefore; if you agree to partner with me, then be rest assured that everything would be done accordingly to meet all legal requirement. I am using a very good lawyer who already has experience in such matters. We will do everything discreetly and quietly without any hitches. But you must promise to follow my instructions at all times. This is my field and I must guide you in order fo us not to make mistakes. Give me a chance for us to achieve this in a very easy way. Please let me know. Thanks! Regards, Qin

"***SPAM Suspected*** Hi beloved One, i need your assistance","Notice: This message was sent from outside the University of Victoria email system. Please be cautious with links and sensitive information.



Hi beloved One, i need your assistance

Please bear with me. I am writing this letter to you with tears and sorrow from my heart.

I am Aisha Muammar Gaddafi, the only daughter of the embattled president of Libya, Hon. Muammar Gaddafi. I know my mail might come to you as a surprise because you don’t know me, but due to the unsolicited nature of my situation here in Refugee camp Ouagadougou Burkina Faso i decided to contact you for help. I have passed through pains and sorrowful moments since the death of my father. At the same time, my family is the target of Western nations led by Nato who want to destroy my father at all costs. Our investments and bank accounts in several countries are their targets to freeze.

My Father of blessed memory deposited the sum of $27.5M (Twenty Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in a Bank at Burkina Faso which he used my name as the next of kin. I have been commissioned by the (BOA) bank to present an interested foreign investor/partner who can stand as my trustee and receive the fund in his account for a possible investment in his country due to my refugee status here in Burkina Faso.

I am in search of an honest and reliable person who will help me and stand as my trustee so that I will present him to the Bank for the transfer of the fund to his bank account overseas. I have chosen to contact you after my prayers and I believe that you will not betray my trust but rather take me as your own sister or daughter. If this transaction interests you, you don't have to disclose it to anybody because of what is going on with my entire family, if the United nation happens to know this account, they will freeze it as they freeze others, so please keep this transaction only to yourself until we finalize it.

Sorry for my pictures. I will enclose it in my next mail and more about me when I hear from you okay.

Yours Sincerely
Best Regard,
Aisha Gaddafi

coffers of a CORONA-VIRUS victim and when checked, it is  $5.8M usd,
in total.the suitcase and the funds was clinically tested and is
NEGATIVE  of any virus. I have kept the suitcase safe in a security
firm here in Syria.I found you trust worthy to partner  with me in
receiving it and we share the funds equally.
please get back to me immediately and let me know if you intend to
partner or not. If you also do not want to be involved kindly let me
know so I would sever further communication with you.

RE: Urgent From Hospital !!!,"Notice: This message was sent from outside the University of Victoria email system. Please be cautious with links and sensitive information.



Hello,


This is Ms Michelle Peillle. I am writing from a hospital in Ivory Coast, therefore this mail is very urgent, I am dying in the hospital which I do not know what tomorrow will be. I have been told by my doctor that I was poisoned and have got my liver damaged and can only live for weeks more, and my step mother is the one that wants to kill me, to take my belongings since after the death of my Father.


I have a little orphan child, named Emilie and [Eight Million Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars] I inherited from my late father, my step mother and her children are after Emilie because she knew about the documents of the money and about the poison, for this reason they do not want Emilie to expose them, so they will do anything possible to kill her, so I want you to help her out of this country with the money.


This is the favor I need when you have gotten the money: -


(1) Set out 40% of the money to establish my daughter Emilie as she has been there for me throughout my illness and I have promised to support her in life. I want you to take her along with you to your country and establish her as your daughter.


(2) Give 30% of the money to the less privileged and charity organizations and schools. The remaining 30% should be for you and others that you would love to assist.


Note; This should be a code between you and Emilie in this transaction &quot;Hospital&quot; any mail from her, the Lawyer she will direct you to, without this code &quot;Hospital&quot; is not from Emilie, the Lawyer or myself as I don't know what will happen to me in the next few hours. Contact my daughter Emilie on her email and telephone number below.


Emilie Peillle
emilie-peillle@hotmail.com
Telephone: &#43;225 050574 0164


She will give you the documents of the money and will direct you to a well known lawyer that I have appointed to her, the lawyer will assist you to change the documents of the money to your name to enable the bank transfer the money to you.


Emilie is a young girl therefore guides her. And if I did not hear from you within days, I will look for another person or an organization for the same purpose.
Thanks for your acceptance to help accomplish my wish.


Ms Michelle Peillle.

Hello Dear One,

Greetings and Sorry for intruding into your privacy.

My name is Mrs.Tan Ruby and I am a Cancer Patient and the disease
have taken over my entire system according to medical diagnosis and I
want to donate my inheritance fund ($36 Million Dollars) that my late
husband left in a financial house  to you because
recently, the doctor told me that I might not survive the latest
Surgery which I have been booked for.

I want you to use 30% of the fund to build orphanage homes in while
20% goes to Cancer research programmes and then donate 25% to
institutions housing elderly and retired persons who bore no children
in their lifetime just like me and my late husband. The remaining 25%
goes to you as the person who agreed to carry out my last wish and  I
will give you more details only if you are willing and ready to handle
this project.

Please reach me on this email address (rubytan2021@gmail.com<mailto:rubytan2021@gmail.com>)

Yours Sincerely.
Mrs. Tan Ruby

Subject: Canada Prestige Awards 2022 - Shortlist

Good day,

The nomination stage of our Canada Prestige Awards 2021/22 is open and we would like to invite to you to take part.

We are reviewing submissions for companies, individuals, products and services throughout Canada and thought you may want to be considered this year.

The Prestige series provides the latest news and developments in a variety of industries. Content is available in hard copy print media as well as online features, interviews, competitions and much more. The awards recognise the important work of SME’s and celebrate their many successes and outstanding service over the year.

To learn more about the media platform then please visit www.prestige-awards.co.uk<http://www.prestige-awards.co.uk>

If you wish to access any subscriber-only content on the website then please let me know and I will provide this on a complimentary basis.

What do I need to do?

Please send us a quick reply to confirm you wish to be considered in this year’s program.

Once we receive your acceptance, you will be placed on the shortlist and our research team will start work immediately on the supporting documents.

Questionnaire & Categories

During the nomination process we give companies and individuals the opportunity to specify the categories they wish to be considered for. We also provide all nominees with the opportunity to submit additional information that may support them being successful in the awards. This could include details on the company, new projects, positive media attention/ other recognition or direct us to online testimonials and customer reviews then this may all have a positive impact on the decision making. Please fill in the short questionnaire provided and include any information you feel relevant.

The questionnaire can be provided once you confirm your participation.

Tell me more about the award programme & who votes?

Every year, we invite companies to talk to us about themselves and provide information on why they are worthy of recognition in the awards. We receive submissions from business of all sizes who provide products and services to Canada. The judges pick a selection of winners in a range of categories.

The awards are a free to enter program that provides exposure to subscribers looking for information on the very best companies and services in the industry.

Once the submissions have been reviewed then winners will be notified by a member of the awards team. Each winner will receive coverage in the awards magazine as well as the website, press releases and at several events.

Are there any costs?

Unlike many awards programs, we offer no options for companies or individuals to make any financial contributions prior to this year’s decisions being made. This includes booking of advertorial space or partnership opportunities of any kind.

Winners are chosen by our independent panel made up of select industry experts and our editor-in-chief. This ensures the most deserving are picked each year and decisions cannot be influenced by current relationships.

I hope we can have you involved in the program and I would be happy to answer any other questions you may have.

Kind regards,

Andre Smith

URGENT!!!,"Greetings,


My name is CHIMEZIE John Madueke, I got your contact from the chamber of commerce as an accredited Investor.

My mother, Mrs. Dieziani Alison-Madueke was the former Minister of Petroleum from April 2010 – 28 May 2015 Under the Administration of the former President of Nigeria, Mr. Goodluck Ebele Johnathan.

During my mother tenure in office, she was able to acquire millions of dollars through deals done with several multinational oil corporations using her office as the Minister of Petroleum

A lot of these funds were invested and deposited in several offshore accounts in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.

One of such investments is the acquisition of Gold mines and bullion in excess of two hundred and fifty million dollars ($250,000,000.00) in the Republic of South Africa and Europe.

As you can see from the current trend of events and change of Government in Nigeria, the present administration and wicked enemies of my mother are witch-hunting and accusing her of bribery and corruption. She stands to loose it all if care is not taken,  all that we have suffered for. I reject it and will not stand by and watch this happen!

Currently, my hard working mother is ill with cancer and battling for her dear life in a London hospital. As if this is not enough suffering already, the British National Crime Agency has arrested her for questioning on these corruption charges.

So read the news below:

http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/10/diezani-alison-madueke-arrested-in-london/

I will want you to help me secure my mothers properties (fund) so that we can invest it into your firm. Can you assist me? You will be greatly rewarded. I believe we can do business together...

Please reply if you think you can be of assistance and we can establish communication

My best wishes,

CHIMEZIE John Madueke

Hi,

I am trying to set up an E-Transfer in the amount of $1,950 for an expense, also i will have to visit the bank to set it up as we don't E-transfers or pay bills online as we have a 2 signature account, I would like to know if you can initiate the E-transfer from your personal account and put it as a request for reimbursement. Let me know so I can send you necessary details, Thanks.

Regards,
Kirk Mercer

Excuse me for this sudden contact with you today as I believe that this message may come to you as a surprise, I got your email address through an online email directory, I really don't know how you will find my contacts with you, I am a 22 years old girl without any parents.

I am writing you this message with tears and sorrow and I know this message may come to you as a surprise,  Am the only daughter. My father was a very wealthy cocoa merchant in Abidjan Ivory Coast (Côte D'ivoire) . My father was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their outings on a business trip.

My mother died when I was a baby and since then my father has treated me so special. Before the death of my father in a private hospital here in Abidjan he secretly called me on his bed side and told me that he has the sum of (7,500,000.00) seven million five Hundred thousand US Dollar, in one of the international banks here in Abidjan, he used my name as his only daughter for the next of Kin in depositing of the fund. My late father instructed me to seek a foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money and use it for investment purposes such as real estate management or hotel management.

Please don't be surprised by my proposal, I was directed to you by God. I have been in the hotel room since two weeks ago looking for someone to even trust to contact before I saw your profile On the internet..

My uncle is a drug addict and he did not care about me In 2019 my uncle sold all my late fathers properties now he has found out that my late father deposited this Fund in the bank with my name as his next of kin and he is requiring me to follow him to the bank so that he can have access in my late father Fund, Which I can never do that in my life because this fund  is the only thing  that I have to set up my future.

All my intentions now are to transfer these funds out from my country for investment, I am seriously having a difficult time here, I am writing this email from a local hotel where I am currently hiding for my safety.

All I require from you is to assist me stand as the guardian and foreign associate of my late father so that the bank will be able to release the funds to your bank account in your country for investment.

I am honorarily seeking your assistance in the following ways:(1) To provide a bank account in which this money would be transferred to .(2) To serve as my guardian.(3) To make arrangements for me to come over to your country to further my education.

I have all the account details which my late father used to deposit the fund here in the hotel with me and the death certificate of my late father.

Note: I am willing to offer you 20% of the total sum as compensation for your effort/ input after the successful transfer of this fund to your nominated bank account. Anticipating hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Koffi Aya

Hello Dear,

Sorry to invade your privacy, I am Mrs. Marie Richard from Switzerland
lived in Burkina Faso for 20years and currently residing in London
United Kingdom, a widow to late Mr. Richard Perdue, my husband worked
with Metalor Technologies International, a Switzerland limited
companies here in Burkina Faso, that export gold and sold to the
industrial mines for ten years before he died in the year 2012. When
my late husband was alive he deposited sum amount of Money $4.5
million dollars in my name with a Bank here in Burkina Faso, presently
this money is still with the Bank.

I am in a hospital in Burkina Faso receiving treatment and my health
condition has gotten worse and just two weeks ago my doctor informed
me that my condition has reach a critical stage, and that I have just
few weeks to live on earth due to my esophageal cancer. This
confirmation from my doctor is devastating news; it is hard to know
that I have just a little time left to live here on earth.

We were married for Eighteen years with a daughter (Nancy) who later
died in a motor accident. I took this decision because I don't have
any child that will inherit this money, Please I choose you to receive
this money on my behalf, and use it to help the less privileged,
orphanages, poor people's etc. I selected you after searching I prayed
and slept over it asking God to provide for me a Godly minded person
that will assist me in this project, then I was led to you.  I will
give you more details of the project in my next mail. Kindly reply to
me as soon as possible so that I will let you know the next steps and
procedures to follow in order to finalize this transfer immediately.

Yours Sincerely
Mrs. Marie Richard.

GREETINGS...,"Greetings,

My name is CHIMEZIE John Madueke, I got your contact from the chamber of commerce as an accredited Investor.

My mother, Mrs. Dieziani Alison-Madueke was the former Minister of Petroleum from April 2010 – 28 May 2015 Under the Administration of the former President of Nigeria, Mr. Goodluck Ebele Johnathan.

During my mother tenure in office, she was able to acquire millions of dollars through deals done with several multinational oil corporations using her office as the Minister of Petroleum

A lot of these funds were invested and deposited in several offshore accounts in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.

One of such investments is the acquisition of Gold mines and bullion in excess of two hundred and fifty million dollars ($250,000,000.00) in the Republic of South Africa and Europe.

As you can see from the current trend of events and change of Government in Nigeria, the present administration and wicked enemies of my mother are witch-hunting and accusing her of bribery and corruption. She stands to loose it all if care is not taken,  all that we have suffered for. I reject it and will not stand by and watch this happen!

Currently, my hard working mother is ill with cancer and battling for her dear life in a London hospital. As if this is not enough suffering already, the British National Crime Agency has arrested her for questioning on these corruption charges.

So read the news below:

http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/10/diezani-alison-madueke-arrested-in-london/

I will want you to help me secure my mothers properties (fund) so that we can invest it into your firm. Can you assist me? You will be greatly rewarded. I believe we can do business together...

Please reply if you think you can be of assistance and we can establish communication

My best wishes,

CHIMEZIE John Madueke

Please accept my apologies. I do not want to invade your privacy, I
had written you a previous email but with no response, in my first
email I mentioned about my deceased client, who has the same last name
as yours, and since his death I have received several letters from his
Bank where he made a deposit of $10.4 million prior to his death the
Bank has asked me to provide his next of kin or the bank seized the
fund as I am unable to locate any of his next of kin so I have
contacted him for this claim as he has same last name as my deceased
client.

"***SPAM Suspected*** GREETINGS,","Greetings,

Assalam alaikum,
I have a proposal for you, however is not mandatory nor will I in any
manner compel you to honor against your will. I am Mr Nelson Lee Milestone,

A business Partners to former executive director of Arab Tunisian Bank
here in Tunisia;
He retired A year and 7 months ago after putting in 28 years of
meticulous service. During his days with Arab Tunisian Bank, I was the
personal account officer and one of the financial advisers to Mr. Zine
Al-Abidine Ben Ali the past Tunisian President in self exile at Saudi
Arabia. During his tryer period he instructed me to move all his
investment in my care which consists of US$115M and 767KG of gold out
of the Gulf States for safe keeping; and that I successfully did by
moving US$50M to Madrid Spain, US$50M to Dubai United Arab Emirate,
US$15M to Burkina Faso and the 767KG of gold to Accra Ghana in West
Africa as an anonymous deposits, so that the funds will in no way to
be traced to him. He has instructed me to find an investor who would
stand as the beneficiary of the fund and the gold; and claim it for
further investment.

Consequent upon the above, my proposal is that I would like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the beneficiary of this fund and the gold
which I have successfully moved outside the country and provide an
account overseas where this said fund will be transferred into. It is
a careful network and my voluntary retirement from the Arab Tunisian
Bank is to ensure a hitch-free operation as all modalities for you to
stand as beneficiary and owner of the deposits has been perfected by
me. Mr. Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali will offer you 20% of the total
investment if you can be the investor and claim this deposits in Spain
and Burkina Faso as the beneficiary.


Now my questions are:-

1. Can you handle this transaction?
2. Can I give you this trust?

Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible so that I can
give you more details regarding this transaction. Finally, it is my
humble request that the information as contained herein be accorded
the necessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves
I expect your urgent response if you can handle this project.

Respectfully yours,
From:Mr Nelson Lee Milestone.

"***SPAM Suspected*** Dear My Beloved One, i need your assistance,","Dear My Beloved One, i need your assistance,

Please bear with me. I am writing this letter to you with tears and sorrow from my heart.

I am Aisha Muammar Gaddafi, the only daughter of the embattled president of Libya, Hon. Muammar Gaddafi. I know my mail might come to you as a surprise because you don’t know me, but due to the unsolicited nature of my situation here in Refugee camp Ouagadougou Burkina Faso i decided to contact you for help. I have passed through pains and sorrowful moments since the death of my father. At the same time, my family is the target of Western nations led by Nato who want to destroy my father at all costs. Our investments and bank accounts in several countries are their targets to freeze.

My Father of blessed memory deposited the sum of $27.5M (Twenty Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in a Bank at Burkina Faso which he used my name as the next of kin. I have been commissioned by the (BOA) bank to present an interested foreign investor/partner who can stand as my trustee and receive the fund in his account for a possible investment in his country due to my refugee status here in Burkina Faso.

I am in search of an honest and reliable person who will help me and stand as my trustee so that I will present him to the Bank for the transfer of the fund to his bank account overseas. I have chosen to contact you after my prayers and I believe that you will not betray my trust but rather take me as your own sister or daughter. If this transaction interests you, you don't have to disclose it to anybody because of what is going on with my entire family, if the United nation happens to know this account, they will freeze it as they freeze others, so please keep this transaction only to yourself until we finalize it.

Sorry for my pictures. I will enclose it in my next mail and more about me when I hear from you okay.

***SPAM Suspected*** FROM JOHN F. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (JFK) NEW YORK USA,"Notice: This message was sent from outside the University of Victoria email system. Please be cautious with links and sensitive information.


Assistant Inspection Director
John F. Kennedy International Airport
Queens New York, 11430
United States

Hello Good Friend,

I am Mr. Mark Shadrach. a senior officer at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) New York. during my search for undelivered parcels I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat from Africa and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a metal trunk box which could be approximately 12.5Million dollars. The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as “MONEY” rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non Inspection Charges which is $3,800USD. On my assumption the consignment is still left in our Storage House here at the John F. Kennedy International Airport Queens New York till date. The details of the consignment including your name, your email address and the official documents from the United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the Trunk box.

However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment as the assistant director of the Inspection Unit, I will advise you provide your current Phone Number and Full Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official documents including the name of nearest Airport around your city. Please note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding the clearance processes so as a result of this, I will not be able to receive your details on my official email account. So in order words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the required details to my private email address for quick processing and response. Once I confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk box, I can get everything concluded within 48hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.

Lastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want us to transact this business and share the money 70% for you and 30% for me since the consignment has not yet been returned to the United States Treasury Department after being abandoned by the diplomat so immediately the confirmation is made, I will go ahead and pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee of $3,800 dollars and arrange for the box to be delivered to your doorstep Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my 30% share... Description of Consignment box to be delivered: Type:......CONSIGNMENT TRUNK BOX Size:....../ 2:1 CM. Weight:...5.6KG. Color:.....BROWN BOX Registration NO: #98952457 Serial #1256784315 Pin number?*****

I wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and interested to receive your box and I will appreciate if we can keep this deal confidential. Please get back to me via my private Email: (markshadrach0@gmail.com) for further directives: You can not call me on my telephone number for it will expose me more.

Thank you.

***SPAM Suspected*** Hello dearest,"Notice: This message was sent from outside the University of Victoria email system. Please be cautious with links and sensitive information.


Dearest,

Good day and how are you doing today. I'm really delighted to
communicate with you and I believe we can achieve everything together
and create something great in

nearest future. My name is Ms. Maryam Muheeb Ahmad Shahbaz. and I'm a
young girl of 24 years old from Kobani a city in the Aleppo
Governorate in Northern Syria and presently, I'm residing in the
Republic of Burkina Faso as a refugee due to the killing of my parents
by the ISIS fighters in the

year 2015popularly known as ""Kobani Massacre"" that was carried out by
the Daesh/ISIS fighters. Please don't be discouraged from hearing
this. I believe deep down

inside me that you will never break my heart or let me down in any way.

My beloved father(Mr. Muheeb Ahmad Shahbaz ) was the Mayor of the city
of Kobani and also the Head of the Aleppo Investment Authority. The
brutal killing of my father

took place one early morning by the Daesh/ISIS fighters as a result of
the ongoing civil war in Syria. I was in my first year at the
University of Aleppo studying Arts

and Humanities before the sad incident and that led to the death of my
beloved father. Darling, I know that it is too early to disclose my
life story to you but please

bear with me. My living condition is very critical, please I need your
possible help to reclaim my inheritance and start a new life. My uncle
has sought to kill me so

that he will have full control of my father's estate but I am happy
that all his evil failed.

Meanwhile, I decided to travel abroad in order to secure my future but
the problem is that since I don't have an international passport, I
cannot be allowed to enter

any Country freely and legally. However, the only choice for me was to
enter Turkey, because it is not far from Kobani and many people are
crossing to Turkey so I

joined them and crossed over to Turkey. It was in my presence that the
Turkish soldiers gunned down Kader Ortakaya a famous woman activist at
the Turkey and Syria

border. A lot happened during this conflict, it was awful, I only
thank God that I'm alive today. I arrived in Burkina Faso through the
help of the International Red

Cross and Red Crescent Movement, they were moving people away from the
Turkish border because of the insecurity of the border, so they moved
some people to Canada,

some to Germany and Italy, and a few to Morocco and Burkina Faso. I
decided to come to Burkina Faso, because when my beloved father was
alive, he revealed to me about

the sum of $27.5 Million which he deposited in one of the Banks in
Burkina Faso with my name as his next of kin. On my arrival to
Ouagadougou, where the Bank is

located,

I contacted them to clear the money, but the Branch operation Manager
who confirmed the deposited amount of money told me that my status as
a refugee according to the

laws of Burkina Faso do not permit me to engage in any Bank
transaction. He advised me to nominate a trustee who will stand on my
behalf and carry out the operation.

This has become necessary after I have been denied the right to own a
Bank account or perform other forms of financial transactions here
because I am a political

asylum seeker. So, I decided to get in touch with you so that you will
help me with the transfer of this money into your Bank account for
investment in your Country.

After you have received the money in your Bank account, you will send
me some amount of money to process my traveling papers because I want
to relocate to your country

where I will start a new life with you. And I intend to complete my
academic studies in your Country. I accept to share my life with you
and give you all my
attention from day one of the meetings. Immediately you confirm your
interest to help me, then I will give you more details as to how we
shall conclude this

transaction. Please do let me know if you are interested in helping me
with the transfer of the money into your bank account for possible
investment in your country so

that I will send you more details on how you will stand as my trustee
and finalize the transaction with the Bank where my dad deposited the
money. I beg you please to

keep this as a top secret between us for confidential reasons. At the
moment I am living in the Mission House. Life in this place is very
unbearable because we are not

allowed to go out and we are monitored by the Church security guard.
Please help me because I want to leave this place quickly to live my
normal with you. Reply to me

at my email address ( shahbamaryam89@gmail.com)

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours truly
Ms.Maryam Muheeb Ahmad Shahbaz .

"hello,","Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is
not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it seriously. This letter must ,
come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that
people meet and become great friends and business partners.


Please I want you to read this letter very carefully and I must
apologize for barging this message into your mailbox without any
formal introduction due to the urgency and confidentiality of this
business and I know that this message will come to you as a surprise.


Please, this is not a joke and I will not like you to joke with it OK,
With due respect to your person and much sincerity of purpose, I make
this contact with you as I believe that you can be of great
assistance, to me. My name is Mr.Kelvin Neil, from Burkina Faso, West
Africa. I work in Bank here as telex manager, please see this as a
confidential message and do not reveal it to another person, and let
me know whether you can be of assistance regarding my proposal below
because it is top secret.


I am about to retire from active Banking service to start a new life ,
but I am skeptical about revealing this particular secret to a stranger.
You must assure me that everything will be handled confidentially
because we are not going to suffer again in life. It has been 10 years
now that most of the greedy African Politicians used our bank to
launder money overseas through the help of their Political advisers.


Most of the funds which they transferred out of the shores of
Africa were gold
and oil money that was supposed to have been used to develop the
continent. Their Political advisers always inflated the amounts before
transferring to foreign accounts, so I also used the opportunity to
divert part of the funds hence I am aware that there is no official
trace of how much was transferred as all the accounts used for such
transfers were being closed after transfer.


I acted as the Bank Officer to most of the politicians and when I
discovered that they were using me to succeed in their greedy act;I
also cleaned some of their banking records from the Bank files and no
one cared to ask me because the money was too much for them to
control, They laundered over $5billion Dollars during the process.
Before I send this message to you, I have already diverted
($10.5million Dollars) to an escrow account belonging to no one in the
bank.


The bank is anxious now to know who the beneficiary to the funds is
because they have made a lot of profits with the funds. It is more
than Eight years now and most of the politicians are no longer using
our bank to transfer funds overseas. The ($10.5million Dollars) has
been laying waste in our bank and I don't want to retire from the bank
without transferring the funds to a foreign account to enable me to share
the proceeds with the receiver (a foreigner).


The money will be shared 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no one
coming to ask you about the funds because I secured everything. I only
want you to assist me by providing a reliable bank account where the
funds can be transferred. You are not to face any difficulties or
legal implications as I am going to handle the transfer personally. If
you are capable of receiving the funds, do let me know immediately to
enable me to give you detailed information on what to do.


Please get back to me if you are interested and capable of handling
this project, I shall intimate you on what to do when I hear from
your confirmation and acceptance. If you are capable of being my
trusted associate,do declare your consent to me, I am looking forward
to hear from you immediately for further information,


Thanks with my best regards.

You have been chosen dear.,"How are you today? Considering the fact that we don't know each other, please I must apologise for any embarrassment it may cause you, I got your email ID from your country's guest book and prayed fervently before I took the courage to write to you.

I am Mrs. Renee Louis, a widow and my late husband who had cardiovascular condition died of cardiac arrest, were i am suffering from protracted cancer of the lung/liver which has also affected part of my brain cells due to its complications and from all indication, my condition has deteriorated and it is quite obvious according to my doctors that I may not live for the next one and half months unless there is a divine intervention because the cancer has gotten to a critical and life threatening stage.

After the Doctor's announcement I decided to WILL my inheritance to the Charity organisations and Humanitarian cause in your country especially for Cancer patients, Orphanages homes.

Recently, The management of my bank officially wrote to me in a two paragraph statement to explained over the unserviceable status of my deposited funds Account since 2016 which has became Dormant and they threatened that the fund could be confiscated upon my failure to adhere to a foreign Account regulatory policy within a stipulated time frame and immediately i wrote them and they were very apologetic and truly sympathised me over my present critical health condition which they saw that I cannot Talk, walk or warrant me to move out from the hospital and be present at their bank.

Dear Beloved, can you handle this project by helping me transfer the fund to your custody and use it as i mentioned above? my husband who could have handled the process of executing MY WILL & TESTAMENT died early this year after an illness, please this is my last WISH and i want 60 percent of this fund to be invested in any charitable organisation of your choice in your country and beyond, administered as you may deem fit, if you wish. Let 20% of the fund could also be expended on logistic support and other sundry arrangements that you may require as soon as the fund gets to you, while 20% will be for you as the project organiser, I took this painstaking decision in other to help humanity in my little capacity before I rest in peace in heavenly bosom.

As soon as I receive your response, I shall use them to write a Letter of Authorization which I shall send to my bank and copy to you so that they will recognize your status as my representative.

Please assure me that you will not treat this offer with levity but will rather give my request continued existence. Awaiting for your quick response while craving your appreciation of my predicament, and please Kindly contact me immediately,

Yours sister,
Mrs. Renee Louis

***SPAM Suspected*** I need your urgent reply,"

Hello,

I got your email address contact details through online searching as a good match for future business that will make both of us very happy! Allow me to introduce myself properly, my name is Ms.KONE ROSE SANOU, I am currently the regional manager of United Bank of Africa Burkina Faso. I understand that this message must seem quite strange but I assure you, if my sources are correct, together we will be able to ensure the success of my proposal.

As the Regional Bank Manager, it is part of my job to send financial reports to my head office Burkina, over the course of 2018 – 2019 I was looking at the years  fiscal report’s and I discovered that the branch that I am managing has funds that are not accounted for according to my head office. I have taken certain steps to make sure that these funds will also go undetected on all accounts. I have set this up so it will be risk free and like I said, if my sources are correct about you, everything will go perfectly.

Currently the funds are in “escrow” without a beneficiary, basically put, the account is waiting for me to add a beneficiary to the account to allow the funds to be transferred as soon as our “work” is complete!

As I am sure you are aware, I cannot be seen to be connected directly to these funds, that would cause too many issues and risks for myself, hence why I am contacting you. As long as I have a third party (you) that I would be able to add as a beneficiary, we have open and clear communication together, both of us will be able to walk away more than happy and both with a new friend for life, I am sure!

I am in contact with several other potential prospects that my sources have informed me would also be a successful match, so a quick response would be in your best interest if you would like to proceed and receive further details.

If you are interested to hear more details, please fill in the information below:

First Name

I will use these details as an initial confirmation, if several of my prospects shall send me a response, I will slowly narrow down the process to find the best option possible to complete the transactions.

I appreciate your timely response and I look forward to being in further contact with you along our venture.

Have a great day!

Waiting to hear from you....,"My dear Friend and Beloved,

With warm hearts and joy in the Lord Jesus, I write this mail to you.
I am Ms Renate Settnik, a German Citizen, but living in Burkina Faso.
I am a Widow of 67 years old, without any children.

I am a devoted Christian and have the fear of God. I am a
philanthropist and a care-giver. I inherited a huge amount of money
from my late husband who was a Crude Oil dealer before he was killed
during the Burkina Faso Political unrest that happened 6 years ago in
August 2016.

Due to his death, that resulted me to too much stress and tension,
thereby causing me to contract Paralysis.
What worries me is that I am down with FULL-BODY PARALYSIS. I cannot
walk, nor stand. I have been bedridden for Three years now.

Since I know that I have very limited time to stay on earth before I
die according to my Doctors, I have been helping and contributing some
amounts of money to Orphanage Homes and to Charity Organizations, as
well as Foundations.

With the help of the Bishop of the Catholic church where I worship, I
have given donations to over 10 Charity Organizations and Foundations,
in Africa,Asia, South America, etc, From findings, i found you trust
worthy among the remaining to be given donations, I will be giving you
the token sum of €25, 000,000.00.Euro

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the
Catholic Bishop where you will send him your bank details and other
requirements he may need from you .I want you and the church to always
pray for me.

Get back to me if you are interested and ready to handle this
transaction for charity work through my email:  mmrsrenate@gmail.com

Thanks for your cooperation.
Best regards,
Mrs.Renate Magdalena Settnik.

"$50 to $400 Cash Bonus From a Division of  CIBC bank, Simplii Financial.","Notice: This message was sent from outside the University of Victoria email system. Please be cautious with links and sensitive information.


$50 to $400 Cash Bonus From a Division of  CIBC bank, Simplii Financial.

Simplii Financial, is a Canadian direct bank, so it does not have branches; however, it is a division of  CIBC bank; thus, you can use your Simplii Financial bank card to withdraw/deposit money at certain CIBC bank banking machines without being a CIBC bank member.

Simplii Financial is having a $50 to $400 Cash Bonus offer for anyone who opens a no fee chequing bank account with them and set up an on going direct deposit into that chequing account.

   *   It is $50 Cash Bonus for the No Fee Chequing Account.
   *   Plus, another $350 Cash Bonus, if you open a No Fee Chequing Account (previous step)  AND  add an eligible direct deposit of at least $100 a month to this chequing account for 3 straight months. Your payroll, pension or employment insurance should be eligible direct deposits.
Here are the details on how to get it started. It is a no fee chequing account. All you have to do is open an online chequing account with them.  Then you deposit yourself  $100(you will have to wait for your bank card to arrive in the mail first, then you can visit a CIBC Bank banking machine to deposit yourself a $100 cash or $100 cheque into your Simplii account).  They do need you to have a minimum of $100 in your Simplii Financial online bank account in order to receive the $50 or $400 bonus offer. But, you don’t have to keep the $100 there forever. You can keep it there until they deposit the $50 or $400 bonus into your account. Here is the link to get started (it might take a second to load): https://mbsy.co/3mr2V2

This is a 100% real offer from, Simplii Financial, a Canadian direct bank, not a scam. You can call CIBC bank at  1-800-465-2422 to confirm that Simplii Financail is real and it is part of their subsidiary.
You can contact Simplii Financial (1-888-723-8881 ) to find out more.
Service in English 1-888-723-8881
Please use the following Link (it might take a second to load) to get started.

***SPAM Suspected*** I await your swift urgent reply.,"Hello

I am Mr.Will  Stuempfle , head of luggage/baggage storage facilities (Operations, Maintenance, and Transportation) here at the International Airport where I work. During my recent withheld package routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discovered an abandoned CONSIGNMENT  and when scanned, it revealed a total amount of  (USD$5,500,000.00) in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately 177kg.


The Airport management has mandated me to release the package to the owner and the OWNER that abandoned it is nowhere to be found since (3 years) ago.Therefore I want to front you as the legitimate owner of the luggage so that you can officially receive it in good faith without any problems and we will SHARE the money. Note that with my position I shall facilitate these transactions in such a way that there will not be any problems on both sides.Therefore these transactions are totally 100% risk and scam free so you have nothing to fear about. We shall finalize these transactions within (4 days) once started. I got your email address as I was surfing the internet for a reliable and honest person that could be able to  handle these blessed  transactions and after
praying God told me to contact you.


This transaction is 100% risk free.You have nothing to regret at all because this is life's golden opportunity and we dare not miss it.TRIAL WILL CONVINCE YOU!!




 I await your swift urgent reply.

"***SPAM Suspected*** Hello.....,","

 Good day, Dearest One,

Please be honest with me. My name is Mrs. Sarah Dickmann, I am a dying woman who has decided to donate what I have to Charities. I am 75 years old and was diagnosed with cancer about four years ago, immediately after the death of my husband.

I have been touched to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband for the good work rather than allow his relatives to lavish my husband's hard-earned fund.

As I lay on my sickbed, I want you to help me in carrying out my last wish on earth which will also be very profitable to you. I want to WILL a total sum of $5.5 million USD to you which I want you to distribute part of it to any charity home for me and the rest for yourself and your family, I will inform you on how to share it all.

Please for further information contact me ASAP.

I will be looking forward to hearing from you.

Warm Regards,
Mrs. Sarah Dickmann

I""m serving as a minister, there is a limit to my personal income and investment level, I cannot receive such a huge sum back to my country or my personal account, so an agreement was reached with the foreign companies to direct the gratifications to an open beneficiary account with a financial institution where it will be possible for me to instruct further transfer of the fund to a third party account for investment purpose which is the reason i contacted you to receive the fund as my partner for investment in your country.

The amount is valued at Euro 47,745,533.00 with a financial institution waiting my instruction for further transfer to a destination account as soon as I have your information indicating interest to receive and invest the fund, I will compensate you with 30% of the total amount and you will also get benefit from the investment.


If you can handle the fund in a good investment.Reply to: r3em.al@yandex.com

I sent this mail praying it will find you in a good condition, since I myself am in a very critical health condition in which I sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am Mrs Louisa Besson, a widow suffering from a long time illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband, the sum of ($11,000,000.00, Eleven Million Dollars) my Doctor told me recently that I have serious sickness which is a cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the way I am going to instruct herein. I need a very honest God.

fearing a person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages, widows and also build schools for less privileges that will be named after my late husband if possible and to promote the word of God and the effort that the house of God is maintained. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. That's why I' making this decision. I'm not afraid of death so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want your sincere and urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute this project, and I will give you more information on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting for your reply.

May God Bless you,
Mrs Louisa Besson.

My name is Mrs. Grace  Shaw, I am a dying woman who has decided to donate what I have to the Charities. I am 75 years old and was diagnosed with cancer about four years ago, immediately after the death of my husband.

I have been touched to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband for the good work rather than allow his relatives to lavish my husband's hard earned fund.

As I lay on my sick bed, I want you to help me in carrying out my last wish on earth which will also be very profitable to you. I want to WILL a total sum of $5.5 million USD to you which I want you to distribute part of it to any charity home for me and the rest for yourself and your family, I will inform you on how to share all.

"***SPAM Suspected*** Greetings My Dear Friend,","Greetings My Dear Friend,


Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is
not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. This letter must
come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that
people meet and become great friends and business partners. Please I
want you to read this letter very carefully and I must apologize for
barging this message into your mail box without any formal
introduction due to the urgency and confidentiality of this business
and I know that this message will come to you as a surprise. Please
this is not a joke and I will not like you to joke with it ok, With
due respect to your person and much sincerity of purpose, I make this
contact with you as I believe that you can be of great assistance to
me. My name is DR. IBRAHIM AMED, from Burkina Faso, West Africa. I
work in Bank Of Africa (BOA) as telex manager, please see this as a
confidential message and do not reveal it to another person and let me
know whether you can be of assistance regarding my proposal below
because it is top secret.
I am about to retire from active Banking service to start a new life
but I am skeptical to reveal this particular secret to a stranger. You
must assure me that everything will be handled confidentially because
we are not going to suffer again in life. It has been 10 years now
that most of the greedy African Politicians used our bank to launder
money overseas through the help of their Political advisers. Most of
the funds which they transferred out of the shores of Africa were gold
and oil money that was supposed to have been used to develop the
continent. Their Political advisers always inflated the amounts before
transferring to foreign accounts, so I also used the opportunity to
divert part of the funds hence I am aware that there is no official
trace of how much was transferred as all the accounts used for such
transfers were being closed after transfer. I acted as the Bank
Officer to most of the politicians and when I discovered that they
were using me to succeed in their greedy act; I also cleaned some of
their banking records from the Bank files and no one cared to ask me.
because the money was too much for them to control. They laundered
over $5billion Dollars during the process. Before I send this message
to you, I have already diverted ($10.5million Dollars) to an escrow
account belonging to no one in the bank. The bank is anxious now to
know who the beneficiary to the funds is because they have made a lot
of profits with the funds. It is more than Eight years now and most of
the politicians are no longer using our bank to transfer funds
overseas. The ($10.5million Dollars) has been laying waste in our bank
and I don’t want to retire from the bank without transferring the
funds to a foreign account to enable me share the proceeds with the
receiver (a foreigner). The money will be shared 60% for me and 40%
for you. There is no one coming to ask you about the funds because I
secured everything. I only want you to assist me by providing a
reliable bank account where the funds can be transferred.
You are not to face any difficulties or legal implications as I am
going to handle the transfer personally. If you are capable of
receiving the funds, do let me know immediately to enable me give you
a detailed information on what to do. For me, I have not stolen the
money from anyone because the other people that took the whole money
did not face any problems. This is my chance to grab my own life
opportunity but you must keep the details of the funds secret to avoid
any leakages as no one in the bank knows about my plans Please get
back to me if you are interested and capable to handle this project, I
shall intimate you on what to do when I hear from your confirmation
and acceptance. If you are capable of being my trusted associate do
declare your consent to me. I am looking forward to hear from you
immediately for further information
Thanks with my best regards.

Dear Sir,

I found your contact information from your country’s National Public Record while searching for a last name that is similar to that of my late client. My late client was a business magnate who had lived and worked with an energy company here in Belgium for over two decades, but he died of a heart attack a year following the demise of his wife and two children in a horrifying car accident.

My client has an unclaimed ""transfer on death"" (""TOD"") monetary savings valued at 9.8 million euros. As his lawyer, the Bank has mandated that I present a member of his family to make claims. It is based on this that I seek your collaboration.

With your collaboration, I am in a position to file your name as my client's living beneficiary, so the release of the 9.8 million EUR will be processed in your favour.

Full details will be communicated upon your assenting response.

"***SPAM Suspected*** APPROVED PAYMENT OF US$3,500,000.00 DOLLARS IN YOUR NAME","From: FNB Fund Recovery Unit
Reference: FNB/GOV/20FR22

Dear Fund Beneficiary,

The Department of fund recovery unit has investigated your fund, which has been in the transfer process for some time. During the first quarter of the general Financial Auditing, the recovery unit has recovered your fund at the tune of US$3,500,000.00 (Three Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which was to be paid to you as the beneficiary.

It has been understood by our investigation team that this fund was acquired by you as a result of the initial inheritance of the fund, which your partner was supposed to remit the fund into your bank account some years ago. After the auditing, the recovery unit decides that the entire recovered and the returned fund should be paid to the beneficiary owners within one week. This decision was taken by the Board of the Auditors in the recovery Department, and at present, the fund is in the escrow account.

The recovery unit has approved the release of your fund, and it has also decided that your fund should be transferred to you without any further delay. For the immediate transfer of the fund to your bank account, kindly contact Mr. George Owen on the below information; he will guide you on how to claim your fund.

Contact Person: Mr. George Owen
Position: Fund Processing Manager

am suffering from a pro-long critical cancer, my doctors confirmed I

long-time promise to donate you the sum ($5.000.000.00) million
dollars I inherited from my late husband Mr. Edward Herbart, foreign
bank account over years. I need a very honest person who can assist in
transfer of this money to his or her account and use the funds for
charities work of God while you use 50% for yourself. I want you to
know there are no risks involved; it is 100% hitch free & safe. If you

OTTAWA — When the Liberal government banned 1,500 firearms earlier this month, there was one name in particular on the prohibition list that raised eyebrows: the Blackwater BW-15, a product widely known as a battery-powered airsoft gun that fires plastic pellets.

Chat forums, gun blogs and some corners of social media went ablaze on the news. Had Prime Minister Justin Trudeau really outlawed an airsoft gun? Gun retailers contacted by the National Post were perplexed, saying the confusion heaped new uncertainty onto a sweeping ban that was already set to cost the industry hundreds of millions in unsellable inventory. Would Canadians actually be forced to surrender their plastic toys?

Then someone else notice another name on the list, the Black Rifle Company BRC15B, was strikingly similar to that of an American coffee maker, who tweeted at Trudeau asking whether the prime minister had in fact banned grounds rather than guns. “Say it ain’t so,” Black Rifle Coffee Company tweeted at Trudeau, “did you really ban our Fresh Roasted Freedom in Canada eh?”

   *   Chris Selley: Liberals add even more gun 'ban' incoherence by getting gender involved<https://nationalpost.com/opinion/chris-selley-liberals-add-even-more-gun-ban-incoherence-by-getting-gender-involved>
   *   'Incoherent' Liberal firearm ban excludes several semi-automatics, potentially outlaws big-game hunting rifles<https://nationalpost.com/news/incoherent-liberal-firearm-ban-excludes-several-semi-automatics-potentially-outlaws-big-game-hunting-rifles>
   *   Read the full list of 'military-style' guns now banned in Canada<https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/read-the-full-list-of-military-style-guns-now-banned-in-canada>

And two names on the manufacturer list were versions of the AR15.COM, which shares a name with the website ar15.com, an online community for gun enthusiasts offering discussion forums and resource manuals, among other things. This time gun owners and retailers were understandably left to wonder whether a website was being targeted.

But the truth behind the confusion requires some digging into the somewhat arcane world of firearms manufacturers — and a private military group that featured heavily in the Iraq war.

Firearms are legally identified by a part of the gun called the “receiver,” which houses the main components like firing pin, hammer or extractor. Receivers also carry the serial number used to identify and distinguish firearms. For that reason, firearm bans are really just bans on receivers — often with added restrictions around barrel lengths or muzzle velocity. Many firearms, particularly the AR-class rifles, are highly customizable receivers that allow gun owners to add different types of barrels, stocks, grips and scopes to build a complete rifle.

Ottawa’s firearm ban, announced on May 1, prohibited for sale a number of highly obscure receivers for AR-class rifles — or any others considered “military style” firearms, although the term “military style” is not clearly defined. (Any banned guns already in private hands will continue to remain legal, although the government has suggested it will offer to buy them.) That included little known models, such as the Blackwater BW-15, that were built on a limited basis and are therefore difficult to find online.

The BW-15 receiver was built by Blackwater Worldwide, a U.S. private military company notorious for a botched 2007 mission in Baghdad, when Blackwater guards tasked with protecting a U.S. State Department convoy killed 14 Iraqi civilians and wounded 20 others.

Sometime around 2007, Blackwater ordered 400 AR receivers — imprinted with the company’s trademark bear paw logo — which it planned to sell to clients as part of a small diversification effort within its armoury division, entirely separate from its overseas operations.

The plans were interrupted by the mishap overseas, after which the company was scaled back and renamed Xe Services. It was renamed again in 2010, and is now called Academi.

Would Canadians actually be forced to surrender their plastic toys?

“I don’t think we actually put together more than about 50” of the Blackwater BW-15s, Bill Kirkland, who managed the small Blackwater armoury in Moyock, North Carolina at the time, told the National Post.

Federal agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives raided the armoury in 2008 as part of an investigation into the Baghdad incident, seizing 22 weapons. In 2014, four guards with Blackwater were convicted by a U.S. federal court on murder, manslaughter and weapons charges.

Kirkland is now director of firearms and explosives at the company. He said the Canadian Liberal government’s decision to ban the Blackwater product was likely part of an effort to prohibit any and all receivers in Canada, no matter how obscure.

“I think that’s what they’re doing here, is crossing their ‘t’s and dotting their ‘i’s,” Kirkland said.

Ottawa’s ban purports to outlaw rifles that are “present in large volumes in the Canadian market,” which would not apply to the Blackwater receivers. It also prohibits semi-automatic rifles with “military design” — a designation that detractors say works as an arbitrary catch-all. Blackwater never sold its receivers directly to Canadian buyers, Kirkland said, but those receivers could have been sold to Canadian buyers at a later date.

Confusion around the Liberal ban also included the “Black Rifle Company BRC15B.” Some initially believed it was a reference to the Black Rifle Coffee Company, a Salt Lake City-based firm owned and operated by U.S. military veterans. Canadian entrepreneur and military veteran Evan Hafer started a Canadian branch of Black Rifle Coffee in 2017, based out of St. Alberta, Alta.

Google searches of the Black Rifle Company only bring up the coffee outlet. But the National Post found a limited liability company (LLC) called Black Rifle Company based in Arizona, listed in public records under the name Erik Skaalheim.

In an article dated January 2020 in Everest Media, a website for outdoors activities and firearms, an Erik Skaalheim from Black Rifle Company spoke in detail about his firm’s AR receivers. The company started at a shop based in Clackamas, Ore., according to the article, where it started building receivers, and then “expanded into making their own free-floating handguards, low-profile gas blocks and complete production rifles.”

Skaalheim could not be reached for comment.

As for the AR15.COM, the rifle receiver that seemed suspiciously similar to the name of a firearms website: an employee at the website clarified in a recent video that the same company that runs the Rockwall, Tex.-based site had in fact manufactured a small number of branded AR receivers in the past.

In the video, the employee criticizing the Trudeau gun ban introduced by “prime minister black face,” saying it targets law-abiding citizens while failing to address the illegal supply of guns that are frequently used in violent crime.

I think that’s what they’re doing here, is crossing their ‘t’s and dotting their ‘i’s

The sweeping ban has caused an uproar among gun owners in Canada, and a firearm lobby has been calling on Ottawa to compensate gun retailers and distributors for as much as $1.1 billion for the inventory they are no longer able to sell.

Some have pushed back against a claim made by Trudeau earlier this month that “you don’t need an AR-15 to bring down a deer,” saying it appears to contradict some exemptions written into the federal regulations, in which people who depend on prohibited firearms for “sustenance” can continue to use AR-15s under certain circumstances. Some hunters and farmers use the rifles to kill small game.

The ban on certain barrel sizes had also been interpreted as prohibiting several types of shotguns used in bird hunting, according to some legal interpretations. The RCMP issued a notice last week stating that 10-gauge and 12-gauge shotguns “are below the 20mm threshold” and therefore won’t be banned.

A petition by Conservative MP Michelle Rempel-Garner is calling on Ottawa to scrap the firearm ban and “instead pass legislation that will target criminals, stop the smuggling of firearms into Canada, go after those who illegally acquire firearms, and apologize to legal firearms owners in Canada.” The petition had over 170,000 signatures on May 12.

IMMEDIATE PAYMENT NOTIFICATION,"--
Attn:

This is to draw your attention that your master card lying in suspense
with D.H.L. has authorized us to effect every outstanding payment
immediately based on the new Government instruction.

The only problem now is that we dictated a lot of irregularities
associated with your master card and we will appreciate it if you
answer the following question.

(1) Did you at any time delegate anybody from your family to claim
your master card on your behalf
(2) Were you involved in corona virus?
(3) Are you aware or related to one Mr. Thomas Mick from your country.

Please reconfirm and answer the above questions because Mr. Thomas
Mick came to our foreign payment department and submitted an
application that you authorized your master card to be release to him
with a report that you are now died with corona virus.

After processing the application of Mr. Thomas Mick himself which he
made known to us that he came from you, he succeeded in getting some
required documents as to make sure that we effect this master card as
quickly as possible without any further delay.

The delay in transferring the master card is due to the request for a
power of attorney authorizing him to pursue this payment on your
behalf. He asked for a week so as to submit the document, but up till
now we have not received any of the documents from any of you.

Why? Please forward us the power of attorney by a return E-mail: so
that we can ask D.H.L. to effect this package to Thomas Mick  on your
behalf without delay.

Contact me on this email: atmcenter100@gmail.com

Anticipating your prompt response.

Best Regards.

***SPAM Suspected*** Good day,"Good day

I apologize for not giving you prior information before sending you this mail and through this medium. I, George Mike, an accountant for a Financial institution, write you this proposal in good faith hoping that I will rely on you in Business Transactions that require absolute confidentiality. I want to trust you with this fund ($3.5.million) for investment in your country.

Presently, I am in the grip of this fund ""Three Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars"" readily available for you and I to share,and I am seeking your cooperation to transfer this funds to your place.

I realized this money as part of unclaimed deposited funds in our Bank since 2002 by a dead foreign customer who deals on Gold and Precious stones here in South Africa before his death. And I can not find any of his family information and nobody knows about this.

Immediately I realized this fund ($3.5m Dollars), I placed it in the Sundry Escrow Account here in our bank without any beneficiary information and no one knows about this money except me. Now I chose you to be my partner and I want this money to be transferred to your bank account in your country or anywhere of your choice.

Sincerely, I am ready to give you 40% of the $3.5m while 60% will be
for me, as soon as the fund is transferred into your bank account.

This is bank to bank transfer, therefore, I assure you there is no
problem in this transaction.

Please urgently reply to my email for more details.

***SPAM Suspected*** COMPLIMENT OF THE SEASON,"My name is Mr. Stephen Mensah, I am a newly promoted Branch Manager of
a Bank here in Ghana, West Africa, I got your information during my
search through the Internet. It may interest you to hear that I am a
man of PEACE and don't want problems, I only hope we can assist each
other. If you don't want this business offer kindly forget it, as I
will not contact you again.

I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit both of us,
as the Branch Manager of the Bank, it is my duty to send in a
Financial Report to my head office in the capital city Accra at the
end of each year. In the course of the last year 2021 end of the year
report, I discovered that my branch in which I am the Manager made
excess profit of [US$12.500,000 Million dollars] which my head office
is not aware of and will never be aware of. I have since placed this
fund in a SUNDRY ACCOUNT.

As an officer of the bank I cannot be directly linked to this money,
so this informed my contacting you for us to work together so that you
can assist me and receive this fund into your bank account in your
country for us to SHARE.

I am offering you 40% of the total fund, while you keep 60% for me in
your bank account till I join you in your country for the
sharing/investment of my own share of the funds or better still we can
go into a joint partnership venture, I will appreciate it very much.

As soon as I receive your response through my private mail or whatsapp
me so I will give you more details on how we can achieve it
successfully.


Sincerely,
Mr. Stephen Mensah

Greetings,

With due respect, I make this contact with you as I believe that you
can be of great assistance to me. I need your cooperation in
transferring the sum of $11.3million to your private account. The
money has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years without
anybody coming for the claim.

I want to release the money to you as the relative to our deceased
customer (the account owner) who unfortunately lost his life and
entire family in a plane crash in October 2005. The banking law and
guideline here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after
17 years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as an
unclaimed fund.

By indicating your interest, I will send you the full details on how
the business will be executed.

Please respond urgently and delete if you are not interested.

Best regards,
Mr. Ahmed Ouedraogo.

Attention: Sir

A clarion call from a distressed Investor in Afghanistan. My Principal

My principal, an Afghanistan Woman who worked for the United States
Army before they closed the Military Base in Afghanistan wishes to
immediately relocate her financial funds and Assets to your country to
be re-invested and to start a new life over there. She is open to any
profitable venture in your country and ready to start immediately on

"***SPAM Suspected*** Dear Partner,","Dear Partner,

Please forgive me if my request is not acceptable by your kind person.

I am Mr. Hashim Yarim, who works in CBI (BURKINA FASO) as a non-independent non-executive Director and President of CORIS BANK Intl'. During our last banking audits, we discovered that an account abandoned belongs to one of our deceased foreign clients, Mr. Wang Jian, co-founder and co-chair of the HNA Group, a Chinese conglomerate with important real estate properties throughout the US. in an accident during a business trip in France on Tuesday.

Go to this link:
ttps://observer.com/2018/07/wang-jian-hna-founder-dies-tragic-fall/<http://observer.com/2018/07/wang-jian-hna-founder-dies-tragic-fall/>

I came across your e-mail contact prior to a private search while in need of your assistance also a foreign partner. I am assured of your capability and reliability to champion this business opportunity when I prayed about you.

I am writing to request your assistance to transfer the sum of $15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million United States Dollars) at its counts as Wang Jian's last foreign business partner, which I plan use the fund to invest in public benefit as follows

1. Establish an orphanage home to help orphaned children.
2. Build a hospital to help the poor.
3. Build an asylum for the elderly and homeless.

Meanwhile, before contacting you, I did an investigation to locate one of the relatives of the late Mr Jian Wang who knows the account, but I didn't succeed. However, I took this decision to support orphans and less privileged children with this fund, because I don't want this fund transferred to our Account of Government treasury as an unclaimed fund. I am willing to offer you the 50% of the fund for your support and assistance to transfer the fund to your account.

More detailed information will be sent to the desegregation explaining how the fund will be transferred to you Please continue to achieve the purpose, Reply me on my private E-Mail Address: hashimyarim47@gmail.com<mailto:hashimyarim47@gmail.com>

Waiting for your urgent response.
Attentively

YOUR UNCLAIMED FUND.,"Notice: This message was sent from outside the University of Victoria email system. Please be cautious with links and sensitive information.


--
Attn Please;

I am Mrs. Sarah Williams., an Australian citizen.

I am one of those who have been paying thousands of dollars to receive
(Compensation, Winnings, Lottery and Inheritance) fund online many
years ago but all to no avail.

I met a long time friend who works with the FBI; He gave me the
information that all unclaimed fund has been moved to a Corporate
Finance House in the United States due to fraudulent activities on the
internet.

I was able to travel down to the United States through the help of my
friend and I met with the agent in charge who showed me the full
information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw
your name as one of the beneficiaries, and your email address.

I decided to email you to stop dealing with who ever that is
contacting you about your fund, they are not with your fund, they are
only trying to make money out of you.

I will advise you to contact Mr. Alexander Michael he is the agent in charge.

You have to contact him directly on this information below.
CORPORATE FINANCE HOUSE.
Name : Mr. Alexander Michael
Email : alexanmichbd1@outlook.com

Contact him with your full contact information including your phone
number(s) with your house contact address.

I am 100% sure that he will assist you in receiving your fund.

NOTE: The only money I paid after I met Mr. Alexander Michael was just
$375 for the paper works and necessary documents, that was all.

I wish you the best of luck,

Mrs. Sarah Williams.

Hello dear,

How are you today?
I am Sgt.Leighann.Hester, 32 years old, single  never married before. I am
from Florida USA, a US army by profession. I am here to disclose an
important issue to you as I promised. Please don't expose this secret if
you do not find my offer interesting. Actually, I have about $10.5 Million
Dollars and jewelry packed in a box which I deposited in Globlink Security
 Cargo company vault in Afghanistan for safeguarding. This money was my
share of the enormous amount we made out of the money we encountered during
one of our missions while in Afghanistan.

Now that the US military has been pulled out from Kabul by the order of
President Biden, I am back in the USA but have been seriously sick.
The purpose of this mail is to know if I can trust you enough to request
the security company to move the boxes to your address and once I recover,
I will come over to your home to pick the box. If you can do me this favor,
you will be entitled to 40% of the money and some shares of the jewelry.
The company director had told me that during the evacuation, they relocated
to spain. So, the box is currently in Spain.

If you can assure me of your trust and never disappoint or betray me upon
reception of the luggage, kindly get back to me with your full name,
address, and direct mobile number to enable me draft a letter of
recommendation and send it to the security company immediately .
Sincerely yours,

Sgt.Leighann.Hester,

Hello from Miss Julia!!,"Hello!
How are you? My name is Julia.
I am interested in finding someone to share my love with. Life is empty without true love and I'm here to find a nice man for friendship, love and relationship.
For me, age, distance, race does not matter, rather what I value most is the understanding and love that will exist between two different people.
So in a special manner I would like to further communicate with you if you wouldn't mind, for us to know each other.
I will send you more of my photos as soon as I receive an answer from you.
Miss Julia.
--------------------------------------------------
Hallo!
Wie geht es Ihnen? Mein Name ist Julia.
Ich bin daran interessiert, jemanden zu finden, mit dem ich meine Liebe teilen kann. Das Leben ist leer ohne wahre Liebe und ich bin hier, um einen netten Mann für Freundschaft, Liebe und Beziehung zu finden.
Für mich spielen Alter, Entfernung, Rasse keine Rolle, sondern was ich am meisten schätze, ist das Verständnis und die Liebe, die zwischen zwei verschiedenen Menschen bestehen wird.
Daher möchte ich in besonderer Weise mit Ihnen kommunizieren, wenn Sie nichts dagegen haben, dass wir uns kennen.
Ich schicke dir weitere meiner Fotos, sobald ich eine Antwort von dir erhalte.
Fräulein Julia.

Proposal On Agriculture.,"Our Ref: Mr.Themba Mthembu
Email— mrthembam2018@gmail.com
Phone- +27-71-700-7449
ATTN: Confidant,


I am contacting you after making official enquiries at the foreign trade office of the Chambers of Commerce here in Johannesburg, South Africa. I haven’t disclosed the nature of my intention to anyone due to the sensitive and confidential nature of the project involved which is my need for assistance in profiling some investment funds and transfer of said funds to your country.


I must plead for your confidence and confidentiality and if it so happens that you are unable to assist in this project, I will crave your indulgence and ask that you do not divulge this to any other third party and ignore this email. I am constrained to issue more details about this mutually beneficial financial project until I get your positive response by email.


The fund in question $40,000,000.00 (Forty Million USD) accrued from over-inflated contract executed by foreign contractors through our connections and the over invoiced amount is waiting to be remitted from a commercial bank here in South Africa. By virtue of my position as a senior civil servant I cannot acquire this money in my name due to the fact that I am bound by the Civil Service Code of Ethics which bars me from operating bank accounts outside our shores. On the other hand it is not safe to keep the funds here due to security reasons; hence my need to source for an overseas silent partner to facilitate the transfer of these funds for our mutual benefit.


My proposal is that after you receive the funds, it would be shared as follows: 30% to you as commission for your co-operation and assistance in facilitating the transfer, while the remaining 65% belongs to me. You will be free to take out your commission immediately after the money is credited to your account in your country. Since our objective is to invest the money in a foreign country, it would be appreciated if you could also help us with advice and direction on investing into profitable ventures in your country.


What we need to do is give you an approval from the ministry and you will email the approval to the paying bank to facilitate the processing and transfer of the contract funds into any of your nominated bank accounts. If you are interested and capable, I request you forward your personal details to my private email address (mrthembam2018@gmail.com) to enable me to contact you for further discussion. I would also request that you send me your most confidential phone number for further communication too.


Respectfully,
Mr. Themba Mthembu
