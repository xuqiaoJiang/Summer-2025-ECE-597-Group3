## 📘 Capstone Project Work Distribution

### 👥 Team Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities | Member | result |
|------|------------------|--------| ------ |
| **Literature & Threat Analyst** | Research phishing detection strategies; summarize key features (e.g., suspicious links, wording patterns); propose ML directions | Hao Ding, Gabriel (✅ Completed last term) | phishing_email_detection_literature_summary.md
| **Data Preprocessing Specialist** | Analyze email dataset structure; clean raw data (HTML stripping, tokenization, header parsing) | Xuqiao | cleaned_email_data.csv data_cleanning.ipynb
| **Feature & Embedding Developer** | Create structured features (e.g., link counts, sender domain); apply bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and embedding models like Word2Vec/BERT |  |
| **Model Trainer & Evaluator** | Train classification models (e.g., NB, LR); validate results using AUC, confusion matrix, accuracy |  |
| **Visualizer & Performance Analyst** | Plot ROC curves, confusion matrices, and feature insights; interpret model strengths and failure patterns |  |
